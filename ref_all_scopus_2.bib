	as socio-technical innovation and change; a framework based on Bijker's
	Technological Frames (TF) is developed and used to model this innovation
	and change. To illustrate this process findings from one case study
	of a large organization adopting the agile software development method
	are presented. Qualitative data were collected from observations,
	interviews, and documents and analysed using TFs. The authors' findings
	show that viewing agile adoption as socio-technical innovation and
	change provides results that resonate with existing research in the
	area and extends it. The key contribution of this case study to the
	socio-technical literature on systems development is a practical
	demonstration of how TFs can be used to facilitate the socio-technical
	understanding and identification of conflicts between stakeholder
	groups while going through the adoption of a new software development

	(XML) for agile supply chains and proposes practical guidelines and
	future research directions for the field. XML has been identified
	by many as a prominent technology for enabling electronic supply
	chain integration, but the adoption of it in the industry has been
	rather slow and limited. This paper discusses the factors that enable
	agility in supply chains, and explains why XML is the best candidate
	for facilitating such factors. Then the major XML-based integration
	initiatives such as ebXML, RosettaNet, and Web Services are diagnosed
	in terms of their pros and cons for supply chain agility, as well
	as the reasons for their slow diffusion. Based on the discussion,
	this paper proposes that: the integration efforts need to first focus
	on the industries that need agility; stringent business process standards
	are necessary; and implementation should be made much easier and
	more affordable for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Further
	research issues are also suggested based on the discussion. © 2011

	Language Engineering (SLE), as systematic approach for language development,
	and develop the right tools for specifying the behavior of BASs components
	along with their energy-related requirements. The goal is to not
	only assist the systems engineers while rapid-prototyping/developing
	affordable, high-quality, energy-efficient(EE) BASs, but also to
	take advantage of high level abstractions, efficient special-purpose
	verification algorithms and analysis tools for early validation and
	verification, in order to promote Quality of the generated software
	products. We are watching to the rise of Model-Driven Development
	as the pragmatic approach to build them, since this approach is based
	on the notion of explicit abstractions/models. This is achieved thanks
	to model transformations that, besides automatically translating
	any specification of a given language into other execution specifications,
	also allow us to derive analysis specifications. The problem with
	the referred types of transformation purposes is that we cannot guarantee
	quality and coherence between the derived specifications into execution
	specifications and combine it with analysis specifications unless
	we can either make use of testing over the execution, with the problems
	already known, or have mechanisms to study the transformations. While
	this problem is motivated by the concrete need of developing BASs,
	we foresee that it can be of general application in SLE. In this
	position paper we will give a state of the art in Building Automation
	and we give an overview of a possible solution that uses MDD and
	model transformations, in the context of a BAS solution, in order
	to check their correctness in w.r.t. the formal semantics of the
	languages used in the target platforms (i.e either execution or analysis).

	of planar upward drawable graphs with a homogeneous field on a cylinder
	and with a radial field in the plane. A cyclic field in the plane
	introduces the new class RUP of upward drawable graphs, which can
	be embedded on a rolling cylinder. We establish strict inclusions
	for planar upward drawability on the plane, the sphere, the rolling
	cylinder, and the torus, even for acyclic graphs. Finally, upward
	drawability remains NP-hard for the standing cylinder and the torus;

  abstract = {Cloud computing offers significant features such as resource pooling,
	scalability, on-demand self service, availability, and reliability
	to organizations to improve their quality of services. For example
	by using cloud computing services in healthcare it is possible to
	reach large population of people in isolated geographical areas which
	will assist in saving their lives in critical situations. It enables
	the use of latest technologies through its various service delivery
	and deployment models via the internet on pay-per-use billing pattern.
	However, cloud computing has dark side when it comes to security
	and privacy considerations. Critical industries such as healthcare
	and banking are reluctant to trust cloud computing due to the fear
	of losing their sensitive data, as it resides on the cloud with no
	knowledge of data location and lack of transparency of Cloud Service
	Providers (CSPs) mechanisms used to secure their data and applications

	kind of proof obligation discharge. Such constraints may act not
	only over the input and output domains, as in a purely functional
	setting, but also over the underlying state space, as in the case
	of reactive components. This talk introduces an approach for reasoning
	about invariants which is both compositional and calculational: compositional
	because it is based on rules which break the complexity of such proof
	obligations across the structures involved; calculational because
	such rules are derived thanks to an algebra of invariants encoded
	in the language of binary relations. A main tool of this approach
	is the pointfree transform of the predicate calculus, which opens
	the possibility of changing the underlying mathematical space so
	as to enable agile algebraic calculation. The development of a theory
	of invariant preservation requires a broad, but uniform view of computational
	processes embodied in software components able to take into account
	data persistence and continued interaction. Such is the plan for

  pages = {214-219},
  note = {cited By (since 1996)0},
  abstract = {Code reviews are an integral part of the development of a dependable
	system such as for airport operations. It is commonly accepted that
	code reviews are an effective quality assurance technique even if
	a rigorous application is also a high cost factor. For large software
	systems a formal method may be inapplicable throughout the whole
	codebase. In this study an airport operational database (AODB) is
	developed with the application of a more lightweight approach to
	code reviews. A continuous, distributed and change-based process
	is applied by the development team and evaluated in comparison to
	team walkthroughs (IEEE-1028) as a baseline method. The application
	showed to be highly useful, equally effective as the baseline, but
	more efficient especially for the preparation, execution and rework
	effort. The results show that continuous code reviews also support
	the understanding of the codebase and the concept of collective ownership.
	Such processes may not completely substitute a more formal and effortful
	technique. Especially for reviewing critical design aspects or complex
	items a traditional approach is still more appropriate. The main
	outcome is that such lightweight code reviews may be used together
	with more formal approaches to ensure a high coverage and that the
	degree of formalism should be adopted to the criticality of the item

	treating the concepts of lean and agile in isolation or combination

	Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts an epistemological
	approach, using the complexity thinking as the dominant paradigm
	from which to investigate the concepts and principles of lean and
	agile. Findings: The epistemological approach to the topic clearly
	reveals the opposition between two thinking principles: the principle
	of simplicity and the principle of complexity. Next, the authors
	evaluated how the complexity thinking principles of Morin may permit
	the two different ways of thinking to be reconciled. They find out
	that, in an organization, lean and agile are not only inseparable
	but also interdependent. Practical implications: The paper shows
	how the concepts of lean and agile can be combined, which may be
	of help to managers and project leaders to adopt from both practices
	and tools to improve their competitiveness. Originality/value: The
	novelty of this paper is the presentation of an alternative approach
	to the concepts of lean and agile, using an epistemological point-of-view.
	The paper deepens the understanding of the lean and agile concepts
	by applying the complexity paradigm as proposed by Edgar Morin. Furthermore,

	Ethernet. In this paper, we review the SR-IOV networking solution

	obtain extra credits that CPU-intensive domains are willing to share.

  title = {Evaluating a fractionated spacecraft system: A business case tool
	for DARPA's F6 program},
  year = {2012},
  note = {cited By (since 1996)0},
  abstract = {The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has recently
	begun an effort to further refine its Fractionated Spacecraft vision.
	This vision (called the "F6" program) seeks to explore distributed
	spacecraft architectures capable of performing complex functions
	similar to current monolithic spacecrafts. However, the ability of
	fractionated systems to work separately would provide significant
	benefits not achievable by monolithic systems. The question of interest
	to this study was "Can these benefits be quantified and evaluated
	in a meaningful fashion in order to compare them to monolithic architectures?"
	Rather than narrowing the approach to one or two concepts, the strategy
	was to expand the decision space in order to generate and evaluate
	a variety of alternatives under different scenarios and design choices.
	The stimuli were specifically selected to capture many issues not
	included in such studies such as technology obsolescence, funding
	profile changes, equipment failure scenarios, and even changes to
	mission objectives during the mission. Each stimulus has a variety
	of decision options or responses which a manager can exercise including
	delay, cancellation, acceleration of a development, or even new developments.
	It is argued that the very nature of fractionation will result in
	systems far more agile to external (and internal) stimuli, but this
	has never been shown explicitly. This study explores the use of Real
	Options in conjunction with traditional Net Present Value techniques
	to quantify the desirability of alternative candidate designs in
	terms of their adaptability and survivability. Our approach to evaluating
	the business case for each use case was to explicitly model both
	the implementation and operation phases for the life cycle of a fractionated
	cluster. The models were integrated into Phoenix Integration's ModelCenter®
	framework and used to generate Implementation Value Metrics (IVMs)
	and Operational Value Metrics (OVMs) associated with the use cases
	under evaluation. A number of models were developed to support these
	evaluations using Excel, Matlab, and Arena® (a commercial discrete-event
	simulation software product). The Model-Based Systems Engineering
	(MBSE) approach used in this study yielded transformations between
	high-level frameworks (OWL and SysML) and the models used to generate
	the data we needed for the evaluation. This rule-based transformation
	process will be critical for exploring the large decision trade spaces
	in a reasonable amount of time. This paper presents the results of
	the business case analyses; the underlying OVM's and IVM's, the approaches
	used to model the problem, explore the tradespace, refine the exploration,
	and generate results. We also discuss possible directions for future
	work. Specifically, it should be noted that while the approach described
	herein is being developed for, and funded by, DARPA, it has general
	applicability to a much wider variety of applications. © 2012 IEEE.},

  abstract = {The gas transfer velocity (KL) and related gas transfer coefficient
	(k2 = KLA/V, with A, area and V, volume) at the air-water interface
	are critical parameters in all gas flux studies such as green house
	gas emission, whole stream metabolism or industrial processes. So
	far, there is no theoretical model able to provide accurate estimation
	of gas transfer in streams. Hence, reaeration is often estimated
	with empirical equations. The gas transfer velocity need then to
	be corrected with a temperature coefficient θ = 1.0241. Yet several
	studies have long reported variation in θ with temperature and 'turbulence'
	of water (i.e. θ is not a constant). Here we re-investigate thoroughly
	a key theoretical model (Dobbins model) in detail after discovering
	important discrepancies. We then compare it with other theoretical
	models derived from a wide range of hydraulic behaviours (rigid to
	free continuous surface water, wave and waterfalls with bubbles).
	The results of the Dobbins model were found to hold, at least theoretically
	in the light of recent advances in hydraulics, although the more
	comprehensive results in this study highlighted a higher degree of
	complexity in θ's behaviour. According to the Dobbins model, the
	temperature coefficient θ, could vary from 1.005 to 1.042 within
	a temperature range of 0-35 °C and wide range of gas transfer velocities,
	i.e. 'turbulence' condition (0.005 &lt; KL &lt; 1.28 cm min-1). No
	other theoretical models showed any significant variability in θ
	with change in 'turbulence', and only modest variability in θ with
	change in temperature. However, the other theoretical models did
	not have the same temperature coefficient θ (with 1.000 &lt; θ &lt;
	1.056 within 0-35 °C). A model integrating turbulence and bubble
	mediated gas transfer velocities suggested a lower temperature dependence
	for bubble (1.013&lt;θ &lt; 1.017) than turbulence (1.023&lt;θ &lt;
	1.031) mediated processes. As it stands, the effect of turbulence
	on the temperature dependence of gas transfer at the air-water interface
	has still to be clarified, although many models simulate different
	flow conditions which may explain some of the observed discrepancies.
	We suggest that the temperature dependence curves produced by the
	Dobbins model may be used tentatively as a simple theoretical guide
	for streams with free surface water but not self-aerated flows encountered
	in whitewater rapids, cascades or weirs. Greater awareness of the
	different models and conditions of applications should help choosing
	an appropriate correction. Three case studies investigated the effect
	of the temperature coefficient on reaeration and stream metabolism
	(photosynthesis and respiration). In practice, the temperature correction
	may be an important parameter under constant turbulence conditions,
	but as the range in turbulence increases, the role of temperature
	may become negligible in determining KL, whatever the temperature
	correction. The theoretical models reviewed here are also useful
	references to correct KL values determined using a reference tracer
	gas to a second species of interest. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	The purpose of this paper is to compare global IT outsourcing with

	Design/methodology/approach: Cloud computing is a model for provisioning

	This versatile platform provides the configurable functionalities

	fidelity and repeatable evaluation of heterogeneous CR networks.
	This approach extends CR design only at device (software-defined-radio)
	or lower-level protocol (dynamic spectrum access) level to end-to-end

	and experimentation of new wireless network protocols and applications

	emulator paradigm for point-to-point communications, we can support
	simultaneous transmissions by network-level emulation that allows
	realistic physical-layer inter- actions between diverse user classes,
	including secondary users, primary users, and adversarial jammers
	in CR networks. In particular, we can replay field tests in a lab
	environment with real radios perceiving and learning the dynamic
	environment thereby adapting for end-to-end goals over distributed
	spectrum coordination channels that replace the common control channel
	as a single point of failure. CR networks offer several dimensions
	of tunable actions including channel, power, rate, and route selection.
	The proposed network evaluation platform is fully programmable and
	can reliably evaluate the necessary cross-layer design solutions
	with configurable op- timization space by leveraging the hardware
	experiments to represent the realistic effects of physical channel,
	topology, mobility, and jamming on spectrum agility, situational
	awareness, and network resiliency. We also provide the flexibility
	to scale up the test environment by introducing virtual radios and
	establishing seamless signal-level interactions with real radios.
	This holistic wireless evaluation approach supports a large-scale,

  abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) appeal to a wide range of applications
	that involve the monitoring of various physical phenomena. However,
	WSNs are subject to many threats. In particular, lack of pervasive
	tamper-resistant hardware results in sensors being easy targets for
	compromise. Having compromised a sensor, the adversary learns all
	the sensor secrets, allowing it to later encrypt/decrypt or authenticate
	messages on behalf of that sensor. This threat is particularly relevant
	in the novel unattended wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) scenario.
	UWSNs operate without constant supervisionby a trusted sink. UWSN's
	unattended nature and increased exposure to attacks prompts the need
	for special techniques geared towards regaining security after being
	compromised. In this article, we investigate cooperative self-healing
	in UWSNs and propose various techniques to allow unattended sensorstorecover
	security after compromise. Our techniques provide seamless healing
	rates even against a very agile and powerful adversary. The effectiveness
	and viability of our proposed techniques are assessed by thorough
	analysis and supported by simulation results. Finally, we introduce
	some real-world issues affecting UWSN deployment and provide some

	Thus, requirement traceability has become an issue for SCRUM practitioners

  abstract = {Usability practitioners conduct formative evaluations, such as heuristic
	evaluations and thinking aloud tests, to identify potential problems
	in a user interface as part of the iterative design cycle. The findings
	of a formative evaluation (in essence, a list of potential problems)
	are usually compiled into written reports and typically delivered
	as a PDF or Word document. A written report is convenient for reading,
	but makes it difficult to reuse the findings electronically. The
	usability markup language (UsabML) defines a structured reporting
	format for the results of usability evaluations. In agile software
	development the direct handover of usability findings to software
	engineers can speed up development cycles and improve software quality.
	Usability managers can now enter the findings of formative evaluations
	into a new, web-based system called Usability Reporting Manager (URM).
	Findings can be exported in UsabML format, which in turn can easily
	be imported by software engineers into an issue-tracking system connected
	to a source code repository. UsabML can also be transformed into
	other formats such as HTML and PDF via stylesheets (XSL). © 2012

  pages = {2-8},
  note = {cited By (since 1996)0},
  abstract = {We consider high-level models that specify system behaviors probabilistically
	and support the specification of cost attributes. Specifically, we
	focus on Discrete Time Markov Reward Models (D-MRMs), i.e. state
	machines where probabilities can be associated with transitions and
	rewards (costs) can be associated with states and transitions. Through
	probabilities we model assumptions on the behavior of environment
	in which an application is embedded. Rewards can instead model the
	cost assumptions involved in the system's operations. A system is
	designed to satisfy the requirements, under the given assumptions.
	Design-time assumptions, however, can turn out to be invalid at runtime,
	and therefore it is necessary to verify whether changes may lead
	to requirements violations. If they do, it is necessary to adapt
	the behavior in a self-healing manner to continue to satisfy the
	requirements. We have previously presented an approach to support
	efficient runtime probabilistic model checking of DTMCs for properties
	expressed in PCTL. In this paper we extend the approach to D-MRMs
	and reward properties. The benefits of the approach are justified
	both theoretically and empirically on significant test cases. © 2012

  year = {2012},
  note = {cited By (since 1996)0},
  abstract = {In 2011, an experiment was undertaken at KTH Royal Institute of Technology
	to introduce agile methods for product development into a mechatronics
	capstone course. This paper describes the method used, Scrum, and
	the context of the studied mechatronics capstone course. Mechatronics
	is here defined as "synergistic integration" of electronics, mechanical
	engineering, control and software engineering. Mechatronics product
	development, in this context, therefore deals with the development
	of complex and intelligent products, which implies multi-disciplinary
	work and the use of models etc. from several domains and areas. With
	the integration of Scrum into the mechatronics capstone course, an
	educational favorable alternative is identified, to previously used
	design methodologies such as more traditional stage-gate methods
	as the Waterfall or method or the V-model. This is due to the emphasis
	on early prototyping, quick feedback and incremental development.
	It still might not be the favorable method for use in large scale
	industrial development projects where formal procedures might still
	be preferred, but the pedagogical advantages in mechatronics education
	are valuable. Incremental development and rapid prototyping for example
	gives many opportunities to reflect and improve. The Scrum focus
	on self-organizing teams also provides a platform to practice project
	organization, by empowering students to take responsibility for the
	product development process. Among the results of this study, it
	is shown that it is possible and favorable to integrate Scrum in
	a mechatronics capstone course and that this can enhance student
	preparation for a future career as mechatronics product developers.
	It is also shown that this prepares the students with a larger flexibility
	to handle the increased complexity in mechatronics product development
	and thereby enabling the project teams to deliver results faster,
	more reliable and with higher quality. © 2012 American Society for

	Howerver, these advanced techniques pose a real challenge in terms

	A typical example in this domain is the significant performance improvement

	by at least one iteration in the waterfall region with respect to
	the Butterfly schedule. This gain in number of iterations comes without
	any overhead in terms of area and without any lose is communication
	performance. Howerver, it results in a throughput improvement around

	in the software engineering field. Combining these two approaches
	has also been investigated. However, the existing research and practices
	only present the principles but fail to develop a framework of the
	software development for practitioners to follow. In this paper,
	a framework about how naïve agile practices could be fulfilled by
	introducing "lean" practices under the DCI (Data-Context-Interaction)
	paradigm is proposed. Lean practice is an end-user-focused and value-centric
	system design. In the proposed framework, lean architecture is complementary
	to agile principles and disciplines and supports agile development.
	This paper is exploring the possibilities of how agile methods can
	restore its lost insights and possibly be reinforced by lean thinking.
	Meanwhile, it is also examined what lean can do "beyond" agile. A
	new lean approach to building domain architecture comes from Data-Context-Interaction
	(DCI) paradigm which facilitates to represent the domain architecture
	intuitively. DCI approach allows us to successfully decouple between
	domain and business-logic features and provides an approach for lean
	practitioners to design system architecture much closer to the real-world
	domain. It is claimed that the investment into lean and agile methodologies
	go hand in hand from organizational to technical aspects by tying
	up with lean concepts as the backbone for agile methods. How lean
	makes it right and how agile makes it fast with the DCI paradigm

	We notice the limitation for sequential software development like
	Waterfall, because it takes too much time to see the moving software
	and get feedback. We are thinking to transform and adopt iterative
	development like Agile. However, there are two major issues on iterative
	development. First, the process structure is not be defined, so that
	we can't verify if the software was made in the right way. Secondary,
	the software quality is evaluated in the acceptance testing by matching
	the user requirements, so that we can't confirm software quality
	from the objective viewpoint using metrics but only from the subjective
	one. These two issues are obstacles to transform to iterative development
	from traditional one. In this presentaion, we defined software development
	process and propose quality metrics evaluation scheme in iterative
	methodology. First, we categorize the iterative development into
	two types, pure-iterative and hybrid. Then, important four parameters,
	such as the sprint term, the release term, integration type and development
	type are detected to define the process structure. Typical metrics
	for sequential development can be used in iterative development.
	But, the metrics in the iteration process must be re-evaluated, because
	the code is not stable during the iteration process due to refactoring,
	requirement evolution and so on. So we proposed the metrics re-evaluation
	scheme. We also provide the example software's result that includes
	process structure, re-evaluated quality metrics, quality control
	chart and fault convergence. By the way, we still have a couple of
	concerns. Obtaining metrics causes the extra work for programmers,
	so it is trade-off of agility. Our assumption for fault convergence
	is seems to be justified in our example software, but, we have to
	collect more example and brush up our assumption. In the future,
	we have to examine more examples to justify the quality of software
	iteratively developed only by defining process structure, without
	obtaining metrics. © 2012 IEEE.},

  note = {cited By (since 1996)0},
  abstract = {Complex software is becoming an important component of modern safety-critical
	systems. To assure the correct function of such software, the development
	processes are heavily regulated by international standards, often
	making the process very rigid, unable to accommodate changes, causing
	late integration and increasing the cost of development. Agile methods
	have been introduced to address these issues in several software
	domains, but their use in safety-critical applications remains to
	be investigated. This paper provides an initial analysis of agile
	practices in the context of software development for the European
	railway sector, regulated by the EN 50128 standard. The study complements
	previous studies on the use of agile methods in other regulated domains.
	A systematic mapping between EN 50128 requirements and agile practices
	showed that all practices support some objectives of the standard.
	Important supporting features recognized were focus on simple design,
	test automation, coding standards, continuous integration and validation.
	However, several problematic areas were also identified, including
	vague requirement analysis and change management. Most agile practices
	must be adapted to suit regulated software development and this analysis
	outlines a subset of the required changes. © 2012 IEEE.},

	approaches to software development. It closes the gap that emerges
	when models are used to abstract from a concrete software system,
	and thus is to models what compilers are to high-level languages.
	Consequently, the simple and fast development of code generators
	is a key requirement of today's approaches to model-driven development,
	which are increasingly characterized by a strong focus on agility
	and domain-specificity. Currently, many techniques are available
	that support the specification and implementation of code generators,
	such as engines based on templates or rule-based transformations.
	All these techniques have in common that code generators are either
	directly programmed or described by means of textual specifications.
	This monograph presents Genesys, a general approach, which advocates
	the graphical development of code generators for arbitrary source
	and target languages, on the basis of models and services. In particular,
	it is designed to support incremental language development on arbitrary
	metalevels. The use of models allows building of code generators
	in a truly platform-independent and domain-specific way. Furthermore,
	models are amenable to formal verification methods such as model
	checking, which increase the reliability and robustness of the code
	generators. Services enable the reuse and integration of existing
	code generation frameworks and tools regardless of their complexity,
	and at the same time manifest as easy-to-use building blocks that
	facilitate agile development through quick interchangeability. Both
	models and services are reusable and thus form a growing repository
	for the fast creation and evolution of code generators. This book
	shows these and further advantages arising from the Genesys approach
	by means of a full-fledged reference implementation, which has been
	field-tested in a large number of case studies.. © 2013 Springer-Verlag

	to traverse wider spaces within a short time. Besides, dynamic heuristic

  abstract = {Following the wired network virtualization, virtualization of wireless
	networks becomes the next step aiming to provide network or infrastructure
	providers with the ability to manage and control their networks in
	a more dynamic fashion. The benefit of the wireless mobile network
	virtualization is a more agile business model where virtual mobile
	network operators (MNOs) can request and thus pay physical MNOs in
	a more pay-as-you-use manner. This paper presents some resource allocation
	algorithms for joint network virtualization and resource allocation
	of wireless networks. The overall algorithm involves the following
	two major processes: firstly, to virtualize a physical wireless network
	into multiple slices, each representing a virtual network, and secondly,
	to carry out physical resource allocation within each virtual network
	(or slice). In particular, the paper adopts orthogonal frequency
	division multiplexing (OFDM) as its physical layer to achieve more
	efficient resource utilization. Therefore, the resource allocation
	is conducted in terms of sub-carriers. Although the motivation and
	algorithm design are based on IEEE 802.16 or WiMAX networks, the
	principle and algorithmic essence are also applicable to other OFDM
	access-based wireless networks. The aim was to achieve the following
	design goals: virtual network isolation and resource efficiency.
	The latter is measured in terms of network throughput and packet
	delivery ratio. The simulation results show that the aforementioned

	It also specifically focuses on the usage of Models and COTS Qualifiable
	tools that automate or facilitate the verification and validation
	of avionics applications constructed from Models in order to ensure
	that there is no unintended function. Software running in Aircraft
	cockpits has dramatically increased in complexity since DO-178B's
	revision in 1992. Furthermore, over the past 20 years, software development
	methods have made significant leaps forward and DO-178B has begun
	to show its age with respect to the new technology introduced to
	facilitate software development. This year the newly revamped DO-178C
	standard sets the certification process record straight by embracing
	modern technology. DO-178C does not only solidify its foundation
	by clarifying its core document but also builds the infrastructure
	to support modern software development techniques already commonly
	used in avionics development for at least a decade. Fortunately,
	DO-178C upgrades and clarifies DO-178B. DO-178C therefore considers
	four techniques of contemporary software development practices which
	are published as supplements to the core document: 1Software Tool
	Qualification Considerations (TQC) [DO-330]2Model-Based Design and
	Verification Supplement (MBDV) [DO-331]3Object-Oriented Technology
	Supplement (OOT) [DO-332]4Formal Methods Supplement (FM) [DO-333]
	Organizations can see gains not only in the reduction of the development
	cycle but also in the overall improvement of the DO-178C certification
	process; including reduction of schedule and costs, and improvements
	in the quality and reliability. In the old school of thought, the
	methodology relies on textual specifications and physical prototypes.
	That is why the informal Text-Based Design approach is tightly associated
	with the waterfall methodology where all the textual requirements
	are manually coded, inspected, and tested on a real embedded system.
	In this method, changes in any part of the waterfall chain are very
	costly and time consuming, leaving almost no room to iterate on the
	design. By contrast, in the Model-Based Design approach, the specifications
	are self contained in the Human Machine Interface (HMI) Model. The
	HMI requirements are defined in an unambiguous way and often captured
	in a formal definition language. Model-Based Design offers a collaborative
	approach to avionics development and allows engineers to inexpensively
	experiment with various concepts by deferring hardware integration
	until much later in the development process. Correcting problems
	in the early modelling phase is undeniably the strongest argument
	in favor of the Model-Based Design approach for developing certifiable
	or non-certifiable avionics applications. This white paper is based

	the potential to influence the distribution of genetic variation,
	with downstream populations typically exhibiting higher genetic diversity
	than headwater populations. Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) are
	widely distributed throughout temperate North America. We examined
	the relationship between landscape attributes, molecular genetic
	diversity and differentiation among lake trout populations inhabiting
	a hierarchically structured freshwater system in northern Labrador
	(the Kogaluk River drainage). Lake trout (N = 567) collected from
	ten lakes in this drainage were examined for polymorphism at 12 microsatellite
	loci. The lakes differed in connectivity, size, elevation and position
	within the Kogaluk catchment. We observed relatively high levels
	of population structure and little migration among lakes. Waterfalls
	were identified as a factor contributing to the observed differentiation.
	Although a preliminary analysis suggested an isolation-by-distance
	pattern, a subsequent decomposed pairwise regression analysis allowed
	the identification of outlier lakes. Removal of these outlier lakes
	and of one other headwater lake, isolated from the rest by several
	waterfalls, led to the disappearance of the isolation-by-distance
	pattern, suggesting very little or no migration among lakes despite
	migration being physically possible. Estimates of effective population
	size correlated with lake area but did not differ between headwater
	and downstream populations, nor was there a relationship with elevation,
	a result consistent with the evidence of very little to zero gene
	flow among lakes. Our study is the first to describe patterns of

	a way of understanding the Scrum process framework as a powerful

	Our objective was to understand the challenges of shared decision-making
	in agile software development teams. Method: We designed a multiple
	case study consisting of four projects in two software product companies
	that recently adopted Scrum. We collected data in semi-structured
	interviews, through participant observations, and from process artifacts.
	Results: We identified three main challenges to shared decision-making
	in agile software development: alignment of strategic product plans
	with iteration plans, allocation of development resources, and performing
	development and maintenance tasks in teams. Conclusion: Agile software
	development requires alignment of decisions on the strategic, tactical,
	and operational levels in order to overcome these challenges. Agile
	development also requires a transition from specialized skills to
	redundancy of functions and from rational to naturalistic decision-making.
	This takes time; the case companies needed from one to two years
	to change from traditional, hierarchical decision-making to shared
	decision-making in software development projects. © 2012 Elsevier

	To address the issues that traditional transport protocols, such

	encompasses a collection of different views and aspects of the enterprise
	which constitute a comprehensive overview. Such an overview cannot
	be well-organized regardless of incorporating a logical structure
	called Enterprise Architecture Framework (EAF). EAF presents a comprehensive
	and transparent map of an organization showing how all organization
	elements (business and IT) work together to achieve defined business
	objectives. It clarifies the way in which these elements support
	the business processes of the organization. Several distinctive EAF
	have been proposed till now, the main challenges any of these EAF
	faced are (1) defining process is heavy, prolonged and tedious (2)
	Keeping EA artifacts up-to-date is an awkward work. These challenges
	make the artifacts of EA useless and unreliable. A number of researchers
	and practitioners try to eliminate these challenges by using Service
	Oriented (SO) paradigm with common and famous EAF like Zachman and
	FEAF. But none of them completely clarify how SO practices with EA
	concepts combination may be realized and what are the important elements
	of it, they just show an abstract mapping between these two concepts
	and state that this combination can be possible. In this article
	we try to present a service oriented EAF (SOEAF) to eliminate aforementioned
	challenges and elaborated this framework in details. CEA Framework
	involves a SO Roadmap that is completely compatible with ITIL and
	a Classification Schema that cover all aspects of organization, these
	aspects categorize according to Purpose, Pattern or Practice, Policy,
	Stakeholder and Resource. We believe that by using the proposed SOEAF

	flexible and agile enough to define rapidly and sense the environment
	quickly then, adapt and adopt business and information changes appropriately.

  note = {cited By (since 1996)0},
  abstract = {Background: An incremental, loosely planned development approach is
	often used in bioinformatic studies when dealing with custom data
	analysis in a rapidly changing environment. Unfortunately, the lack
	of a rigorous software structuring can undermine the maintainability,
	communicability and replicability of the process. To ameliorate this
	problem we propose the Leaf system, the aim of which is to seamlessly
	introduce the pipeline formality on top of a dynamical development
	process with minimum overhead for the programmer, thus providing
	a simple layer of software structuring.Results: Leaf includes a formal
	language for the definition of pipelines with code that can be transparently
	inserted into the user's Python code. Its syntax is designed to visually
	highlight dependencies in the pipeline structure it defines. While
	encouraging the developer to think in terms of bioinformatic pipelines,
	Leaf supports a number of automated features including data and session
	persistence, consistency checks between steps of the analysis, processing
	optimization and publication of the analytic protocol in the form
	of a hypertext.Conclusions: Leaf offers a powerful balance between
	plan-driven and change-driven development environments in the design,
	management and communication of bioinformatic pipelines. Its unique
	features make it a valuable alternative to other related tools. ©

	learning activities in a virtual environment such as online communications
	and pair or small group discussions. In order to model the virtual
	learning environment, the RUP methodology has been used where it
	involves the data collection phase and the analysis and design phase.
	Fifty respondents have been randomly selected to participate in the
	data collection phase to investigate the students' interest and learning
	styles as well as their learning preferences. The results have shown
	the needs for the development of online small group discussions that
	can be used as an alternative learning style for programming courses.
	The proposed design of the virtual learning system named as the Online
	Collaborative Learning System or OCLS is being depicted using the
	object-oriented models which are the use-case model and class diagram
	in order to show the concise processes of virtual "Think-Pair-Share"
	collaborative activities. The "Think-Pair-Share" collaborative learning
	technique that is being used in this model has been chosen because
	of its simplicity and relatively low-risk. This paper also presents
	the proposed model of the system's architecture that will become

	business functions on shared, off-premises computing systems - introduces
	strategic options and business-control challenges for executives.
	For example, cloud computing offers ubiquitous access to applications
	for interacting with all parts of a firm's value chain and it connects
	an organization with the rich learning opportunities percolating
	in communities formed by the users of the service. Design/methodology/approach:
	The paper introduces a capabilities-comparison-matrix approach that
	executives can use to uncover, evaluate and rank opportunities for
	employing cloud computing to advance a challenger enterprise's growth
	strategy. Findings: For a firm hoping to grow, but with fewer resources
	than its rivals, cloud computing offers the potential to do more
	with less, thus benefiting an agile, strategic adopter of its rapidly
	evolving technology and service. Practical implications: Using cloud-based
	services, a challenger enterprise can identify, qualify, engage and
	manage a global network of capabilities to match the captive, in-house
	activities of a bigger, better-established competitor. Originality/value:
	The practical question for adopting any new technology is, "What
	is the value of what can we do (with the technology) that we could
	not do before?" To clarify choices, a capabilities-comparison matrix
	helps decision makers focus on which business activities should go

	framework for large scale image processing and analysis over heterogeneous
	computing resources, such as those available in clouds, grids, computer
	clusters or throughout scattered computer resources (desktops, labs)
	in an opportunistic manner. Through BIGS, eScience for image processing
	and analysis is conceived to exploit coarse grained parallelism based
	on data partitioning and parameter sweeps, avoiding the need of inter-process
	communication and, therefore, enabling loosely coupled computing
	nodes (BIGS workers). It adopts an uncommitted resource allocation
	model where (1) experimenters define their image processing pipelines
	in a simple configuration file, (2) a schedule of jobs is generated
	and (3) workers, as they become available, take over pending jobs
	as long as their dependency on other jobs is fulfilled. BIGS workers
	act autonomously, querying the job schedule to determine which one
	to take over. This removes the need for a central scheduling node,
	requiring only access by all workers to a shared information source.
	Furthermore, BIGS workers are encapsulated within different technologies
	to enable their agile deployment over the available computing resources.
	Currently they can be launched through the Amazon EC2 service over
	their cloud resources, through Java Web Start from any desktop computer
	and through regular scripting or SSH commands. This suits well different
	kinds of research environments, both when accessing dedicated computing
	clusters or clouds with committed computing capacity or when using
	opportunistic computing resources whose access is seldom or cannot
	be provisioned in advance. We also adopt a NoSQL storage model to
	ensure the scalability of the shared information sources required
	by all workers, including within BIGS support for HBase and Amazon's
	DynamoDB service. Overall, BIGS now enables researchers to run large
	scale image processing pipelines in an easy, affordable and unplanned
	manner with the capability to take over computing resources as they
	become available at run time. This is shown in this paper by using
	BIGS in different experimental setups in the Amazon cloud and in
	an opportunistic manner, demonstrating its configurability, adaptability
	and scalability capabilities. ©2012 IEEE.},

	Recent developments, e.g. in design science, design thinking, managing
	as designing, participatory design, and agile project management,
	have provided a number of new approaches that in many ways represent
	answers to the challenges of increased uncertainty and complexity.
	This has led to the development of seven propositions: • Understanding
	mutual interplay of actors - unveiling self-sustaining informal learning
	processes • Involving stakeholders - clarifying who wants to see
	the design succeed • Accepting diversity - working with several perspectives
	in parallel • Experimenting with new ideas - establishing a playful
	and creative mood among participants • Enacting key features of new
	systems design - involving users in testing a series of prototypes
	• Including the organizational context - orchestrating a design effort
	in view of simultaneous development initiatives and top management's
	shifting agenda • Acknowledging that the intentions of an enterprise
	information system are realized through people - An enterprise information
	system only sets the stage for organizational processes. If adopted
	in an enterprise, management will be challenged to carry out design
	activities in a radically different way. © 2012 IFIP International

	The Finnish Information Processing Association (FIPA) as a sampling
	frame. 408 responses were collected from 200 software intensive organizations

	of agile and lean usage in software organizations as well as the
	implementation of specific methods and practices, goals in adopting
	agile and lean, reasons for not applying these methods and effects
	of the agile and lean usage. The results of the survey reveal that
	a majority of respondents' organizational units are using agile and/or
	lean methods (58%). Furthermore, lean appears as a new player, being
	used by 24% of respondents, mainly in combination with agile (21%).
	The reasons and benefits for using agile and lean methods appeared
	to correspond in most parts to the findings of the earlier research.

  abstract = {Past research on the effect of ERP systems on agility is contradictory,
	and research on the post implementation effects of ERP systems on
	agility is limited. Employing a cross sectional field study, this
	exploratory study analyses how key defining features of enterprise
	systems environment - integration, process optimization, and best
	practices - affect agility. Standardization of processes has mixed
	effect on agility and depends on the extent of standardization implemented
	and whether it included prior simplification. Rather than the ERP-system
	enabled environment, the inadequacies in implementation and poor
	process optimization prior to ERP implementation are restricting
	process agility. Extended summary: Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
	systems flexibly support many changes that take place during firms'
	business growth & market down turn and enable fast paced changes.
	As a key component of current IT infrastructure in a majority of
	orrganizations today, ERPs though have delivered cost efficiencies,
	control and consistent execution, their role as claimed by the software
	vendors in enabling agility and innovation is ambiguous with some
	considering it an enabler while others view as impediment. In order
	to position themselves better to respond to market dynamics and changing
	business conditions, firms must have the agility - the ability to
	adapt by quickly changing and reconfiguring the necessary business
	processes. With limited research on ERP post-implementation effects
	in general and on agility and innovation in particular, this study
	employs a cross-sectional field study and analyses how key defining
	features of Enterprise Systems' environment - integration, process
	optimization and best practices affect firm agility in general and
	business process agility in particular. According to study, integration
	and standardization, the key characteristics of ERP-enabled environment
	have mixed and varying effects on business process agility and that
	is dependent upon the extent and type of standardization and integration
	implemented in the organization. Integration across hierarchical
	levels has helped process become more agile through improved visibility
	and decision making, while integration of processes and information
	across functional boundaries has contributed to improvements in the
	speed of execution and ability to reconfigure process components.
	Tight coupling of systems, structures and processes resulting from
	ERP implementation restricts a firm's ability to reconfigure and
	deploy business processes. Study suggests that it is not after all
	necessary for all processes to be agile. The study raises the importance
	of business process management capability of an organization and
	the best practice in building and improving process agility. Rather

  abstract = {Context: Agile methodologies (AM) emerged as a popular alternative
	to formalized methods, and have gained widespread acceptance in both
	the academic and industrial contexts. While most research has focused
	on their early stages of adoption and use, there is little evidence
	that agile methodologies have been effectively used beyond the adoption
	stage. Objective: The objective of this paper is to gain a comprehensive
	understanding of the various factors that impact the sustained usage
	of agile methods. Method: We performed a systematic literature review
	to identify empirical studies relating to agile usage. We followed
	the guidelines provided for conducting systematic literature reviews
	in software engineering [1, 2] using the following distinct stages:
	1) protocol development and the search strategy, 2) exclusion process,
	3) data extraction, and 4) data synthesis. Results: Our review identified
	nine critical factors viz., Management Support, Attitude, Motivation,
	Team Composition, Training, Agile Mindset, Technical Competence and
	Expertise, Agile Engineering Practices, and Methodology Champion.
	Conclusions: Our review highlights the significance of nine critical
	factors that impact sustained usage of AM in organizations. Our findings
	also indicate that the right balance and combination of various factors

  abstract = {As electronic systems are pervading our lives, MPSoC (multiprocessor
	system-on-chip) security is becoming an important requirement. MPSoCs
	are able to support multiple applications on the same chip. The challenge
	is to provide MPSoC security that makes possible a trustworthy system
	that meets the performance and security requirements of all the applications.
	The network-on-chip (NoC) can be used to efficiently incorporate
	security. Our work proposes the implementation of QoSS (quality of
	security service) to overcome present MPSoC vulnerabilities. QoSS
	is a novel concept for data protection that introduces security as
	a dimension of QoS. QoSS takes advantage of the NoC wide system visibility
	and critical role in enabling system operation, exploiting the NoC
	components to detect and prevent a wide range of attacks. In this
	paper, we present the implementation of a layered dynamic security
	NoC architecture that integrates agile and dynamic security firewalls
	in order to detect attacks based on different security rules. We
	evaluate the effectiveness of our approach over several MPSoCs scenarios
	and estimate their impact on the overall performance. We show that
	our architecture can perform a fast detection of a wide range of
	attacks and a fast configuration of different security policies for
	several MPSoC applications. Copyright © 2012 Johanna Sepulveda et

  abstract = {Crowdsourcing is an increasingly used model to outsource certain tasks
	to be carried out by external experts on the Web. Especially when
	lacking experience or expertise with certain task types, crowdsourcing
	offers a convenient way to receive instant support. In this paper,
	we introduce an in-house enterprise crowdsourcing model, which leverages
	the crowdsourcing concept and transfers it to traditional organizations.
	Here, a company's staff is considered a crowd that-besides its regularly
	assigned tasks-can also receive tasks from colleagues from other
	departments and across hierarchical structures. The aim is to offer
	instant support and utilize free capacities throughout a large organization
	more efficiently. In our work, we describe this concept and supporting
	mechanisms in context of an agile software development use case.
	However, in contrast to usually crowdsourced microtasks, complex
	software architectures usually consist of tens and hundreds of connected
	modules that can be potentially crowdsourced. These technical dependencies
	between modules require active coordination and interactions between
	crowd members that process the single artifacts. Hence, technical
	dependencies of artifacts result in social dependencies of collaborating
	crowd members that create them. In order to efficiently discover
	member compositions based on artifact dependencies, we introduce
	an indexing and discovery approach based on subgraph matching. Typically,
	assigning tasks to well-rehearsed teams results in more reliable
	task processing, faster results, and higher quality of work. We evaluate
	our approach in terms of system scalability and overall applicability
	by mining and analyzing the popular SourceForge community. We show
	that our approach of member composition discovery is feasibly in
	terms of scalability and quality of discovery results. Our findings
	deliver important input for the design and implementation of supporting
	information systems for future large-scale collaboration platforms.

  abstract = {Agile methods provide an organization or a team with the flexibility
	to adopt a selected subset of principles and practices based on their
	culture, their values, and the types of systems that they develop.
	More specifically, every organization or team implements a customized
	agile method, tailored to better accommodate its needs. However,
	the extent to which a customized method supports the organizational
	objectives, i.e. the 'goodness' of that method, is questionable.
	Existing agile assessment approaches focus on comparative analyses,
	or are limited in scope and application. In this research, we propose
	a structured, systematic, and comprehensive approach to assessing
	the 'goodness' of agile methods. We examine an agile method based
	on (1) its adequacy, (2) the capability of the organization to support
	the adopted principles and practices specified by the method, and
	(3) the method's effectiveness. We propose the Objectives, Principles
	and Practices (OPP) Framework to guide our assessment. The Framework
	identifies (1) objectives of the agile philosophy, (2) principles
	that support the objectives, (3) practices that are reflective of
	the principles, (4) linkages among the objectives, principles and
	practices, and (5) indicators for assessing the extent to which an
	organization supports the implementation and the effectiveness of
	that practice. In this paper, we discuss our solution approach, preliminary
	results, and future work. © 2012 IEEE.},

  note = {cited By (since 1996)0},
  abstract = {As the build system, i.e. the infrastructure that constructs executable
	deliverables out of source code and other resources, tries to catch
	up with the ever-evolving source code base, its size and already
	significant complexity keep on growing. Recently, this has forced
	some major software projects to migrate their build systems towards
	more powerful build system technologies. Since at all times software
	developers, testers and QA personnel rely on a functional build system
	to do their job, a build system migration is a risky and possibly
	costly undertaking, yet no methodology, nor best practices have been
	devised for it. In order to understand the build system migration
	process, we empirically studied two failed and two successful attempts
	of build system migration in two major open source projects, i.e.
	Linux and KDE, by mining source code repositories and tens of thousands
	of developer mailing list messages. The major contributions of this
	paper are: (a) isolating the phases of a common methodology for build
	system migrations, which is similar to the spiral model for source
	code development (multiple iterations of a waterfall process); (b)
	identifying four of the major challenges associated with this methodology:
	requirements gathering, communication issues, performance vs. complexity
	of build system code, and effective evaluation of build system prototypes;
	(c) detailed analysis of the first challenge, i.e., requirements
	gathering for the new build system, which revealed that the failed
	migrations did not gather requirements rigorously. Based on our findings,
	practitioners will be able to make more informed decisions about
	migrating their build system, potentially saving them time and money.

  abstract = {Background: Antimicrobial resistance has reached globally alarming
	levels and is becoming a major public health threat. Lack of efficacious
	antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems was identified as one
	of the causes of increasing resistance, due to the lag time between
	new resistances and alerts to care providers. Several initiatives
	to track drug resistance evolution have been developed. However,
	no effective real-time and source-independent antimicrobial resistance
	monitoring system is available publicly. Objective: To design and
	implement an architecture that can provide real-time and source-independent
	antimicrobial resistance monitoring to support transnational resistance
	surveillance. In particular, we investigated the use of a Semantic
	Web-based model to foster integration and interoperability of interinstitutional
	and cross-border microbiology laboratory databases. Methods: Following
	the agile software development methodology, we derived the main requirements
	needed for effective antimicrobial resistance monitoring, from which
	we proposed a decentralized monitoring architecture based on the
	Semantic Web stack. The architecture uses an ontology-driven approach
	to promote the integration of a network of sentinel hospitals or
	laboratories. Local databases are wrapped into semantic data repositories
	that automatically expose local computing-formalized laboratory information
	in the Web. A central source mediator, based on local reasoning,
	coordinates the access to the semantic end points. On the user side,
	a user-friendly Web interface provides access and graphical visualization
	to the integrated views. Results: We designed and implemented the
	online Antimicrobial Resistance Trend Monitoring System (ARTEMIS)
	in a pilot network of seven European health care institutions sharing
	70+ million triples of information about drug resistance and consumption.
	Evaluation of the computing performance of the mediator demonstrated
	that, on average, query response time was a few seconds (mean 4.3,
	SD 0.1×10 2 seconds). Clinical pertinence assessment showed that
	resistance trends automatically calculated by ARTEMIS had a strong
	positive correlation with the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance
	Network (EARS-Net) (ρ =.86, P &lt;.001) and the Sentinel Surveillance
	of Antibiotic Resistance in Switzerland (SEARCH) (ρ =.84, P &lt;.001)
	systems. Furthermore, mean resistance rates extracted by ARTEMIS
	were not significantly different from those of either EARS-Net (Δ
	= ±0.130; 95% confidence interval -0 to 0.030; P &lt;.001) or SEARCH
	(δ = ±0.042; 95% confidence interval -0.004 to 0.028; P =.004). Conclusions:
	We introduce a distributed monitoring architecture that can be used
	to build transnational antimicrobial resistance surveillance networks.
	Results indicated that the Semantic Web-based approach provided an
	efficient and reliable solution for development of eHealth architectures
	that enable online antimicrobial resistance monitoring from heterogeneous
	data sources. In future, we expect that more health care institutions
	can join the ARTEMIS network so that it can provide a large European
	and wider biosurveillance network that can be used to detect emerging
	bacterial resistance in a multinational context and support public
	health actions. © Douglas Teodoro, Emilie Pasche, Julien Gobeill,

  abstract = {Context: Agile software development with its emphasis on producing
	working code through frequent releases, extensive client interactions
	and iterative development has emerged as an alternative to traditional
	plan-based software development methods. While a number of case studies
	have provided insights into the use and consequences of agile, few
	empirical studies have examined the factors that drive the adoption
	and use of agile. Objective: We draw on intention-based theories
	and a dialectic perspective to identify factors driving the use of
	agile practices among adopters of this software development methodology.
	Method: Data for the study was gathered through an anonymous online
	survey of software development professionals. We requested participation
	from members of a selected list of online discussion groups, and
	received 98 responses. Results: Our analyses reveal that subjective
	norm and training play a significant role in influencing software
	developers' use of agile processes and methods, while perceived benefits
	and perceived limitations are not primary drivers of agile use among
	adopters. Interestingly, perceived benefit emerges as a significant
	predictor of agile use only if adopters face hindrances to their
	agile practices. Conclusion: We conclude that research in the adoption
	of software development innovations should examine the effects of
	both enabling and detracting factors and the interactions between
	them. Since training, subjective norm, and the interplay between
	perceived benefits and perceived hindrances appear to be key factors
	influencing the adoption of agile methods, researchers can focus
	on how to (a) perform training on agile methods more effectively,
	(b) facilitate the dialog between developers and managers about perceived
	benefits and hindrances, and (c) capitalize on subjective norm to
	publicize the benefits of agile methods within an organization. Further,
	when managing the transition to new software development methods,
	we recommend that practitioners adapt their strategies and tactics
	contingent on the extent of perceived hindrances to the change. ©

  abstract = {Scrum is one of the many agile approaches to software development
	that have been widely adopted over the past decade. Agile processes
	allow developers to embrace under-defined problems in complex environments
	where change in requirements is inevitable. The key agile features
	of Scrum are a flexible, adaptive schedule; democratic, collaborative
	teams; and frequent, iterative project and process reviews [2]. While
	students may engage with Scrum in the context of software development,
	the characteristics that suit many software problems to an agile
	approach also describe the student learning environment: complexity
	(new and unfamiliar concepts), under-defined problem space (students
	don't know what they don't know), short timeframe with frequent meetings
	(terms and class meetings), and inevitable change (apply new knowledge).
	This makes Scrum not only a software development strategy but a general
	learning strategy. Scrum facilitates frequent and iterative practice
	with timely feedback, development of mastery, and self-direction
	[1]. In this panel, the participants will describe how their students
	learn and practice Scrum in a software development context, how they
	use it to manage student projects outside the software development
	context, and how Scrum provides opportunities to integrate communication

	Insights from innovation adoption research can provide a new perspective

	case study findings, the concepts of acceptance, routinisation and

	These adapted concepts were used to glean interesting insights into
	agile practice use. For example, it was shown that the period of
	use of agile practices does not have a proportional effect on their
	assimilation depths. We also reflected on the sequential assumption
	underlying the assimilation stages, showing that adopting teams do

	vehicle parts and D-EIPF is a system evaluation environment for virtual
	vehicle parts. Both of them are based on Computer-Aided Engineering
	(CAE) and use Model Based Development (MBD) simulation technologies.
	First, in the design phase, we create simulation models from the
	control specifications using Statemate and/or Simulink/Stateflow
	and run simulations to check the behavior of individual ECUs alone.
	Second, we create the D-EIPF environment composed of the ECU models
	and communication network models. The latter models run on CANoe
	using multiplex communication and an in-house tool for the harness
	connections. D-EIPF enables system-level testing as well as customer
	aspect testing at an early phase before EIPF tests and in-vehicle
	testing using actual parts. This means that we can validate system-level
	functions before building any bench test system or prototype vehicle.
	In addition, D-EIPF and EIPF use a common test suite that can run
	the same test scenarios between them, which improves traceability
	and development work efficiency. This paper gives a general description

	Design-EIPF (D-EIPF). EIPF is a system-testing environment for actual
	vehicle parts and D-EIPF is a system evaluation environment for virtual
	vehicle parts. Both of them are based on Computer-Aided Engineering
	(CAE) and use Model Based Development (MBD) simulation technologies.
	First, in the design phase, we create simulation models from the
	control specifications using Statemate and/or Simulink/Stateflow
	and run simulations to check the behavior of individual ECUs alone.
	Second, we create the D-EIPF environment composed of the ECU models
	and communication network models. The latter models run on CANoe
	using multiplex communication and an in-house tool for the harness
	connections. D-EIPF enables system-level testing as well as customer
	aspect testing at an early phase before EIPF tests and in-vehicle
	testing using actual parts. This means that we can validate system-level
	functions before building any bench test system or prototype vehicle.
	In addition, D-EIPF and EIPF use a common test suite that can run
	the same test scenarios between them, which improves traceability
	and development work efficiency. This paper gives a general description
	of the life cycle process using the EIPF and D-EIPF system, which
	is a symmetrical process for obtaining strong solutions. © 2012 SAE

	software development methods discourage planning ahead, encapsulated

	the factors that affect how much architecture planning industry practitioners
	do up-front - in other words, how much architecture? Early results
	show that the experience of the architects and predefined or template
	architectures both help to reduce the architectural effort required

	has the required skills or time to solve a sophisticated problem
	on his own. Software development needs the involvement of different
	roles and people having to use concepts and ideas for which they
	need to share a common understanding. In such a context, several
	software development methodologies have appeared in the last thirty
	years. Those methodologies use different development life cycles,
	one of the most famous being the iterative one notably used by the
	Unified Process (UP) and agile methods. To teach software project
	managers and computer science students the required skills to deal
	with such development processes few approaches exist. Indeed, nowadays
	one mostly learns from ex-cathedra courses and books or on an empirical
	basis when involved into 'real life' projects. Both learning approaches
	have major flaws since 'theory-only' fails to highlight the practical
	dimension and empirical learning exposes the organization to damageable
	mistakes. e-SPM is an online multiusers game simulating the tasks
	of a software project manager facing user requirements, development
	planning, human resources allocation, budget constraints, risk and
	quality management within a UP/UML project in the steel industry.
	The originality of the game resides in its design based on the documentation
	and experience of previously performed real-life projects. The game
	mainly focuses on hard (technical) skills for project managers but
	also introduces random events showing to the player which soft skills

	on cloud computing in a library context. Design/methodology/approach:
	The paper adopts an investigative approach including literature review
	and vendor-provided information. Findings: Cloud computing is both
	a trend and technology to deliver software and hardware as a service,
	not as a product. It involves a centralized data center, virtual
	server space, and secure transfer of data over the internet. The
	alleged advantages of cloud computing include low cost to own (CTO),
	agile updates, openness, zero initial investment, just to name a
	few. Lately library system vendors have begun to deliver cloud computing
	options. For instance, Ex Libris will release Alma in early 2012.
	It is an Integrated Library System with a discovery layer based on
	cloud computing. Amazon (Elastic Compute Cloud called Amazon EC2)
	and other vendors also offer virtual servers for cloud computing
	and charge customers by hours, usage, and capacity. If this trend
	continues for the next several years, it is just a matter of time
	before librarians will face the decision as to whether they should
	move into compute cloud. Originality/value: The paper discusses this
	new trend, focusing on the pros and cons of moving into cloud computing
