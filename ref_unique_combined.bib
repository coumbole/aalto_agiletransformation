  abstract = {The enterprises of today need to respond in real time to whatever
	the day brings - a change in supply or demand, a shift in the expectations
	or requirements of customers, the vagaries of capital markets or
	the aftermath of a natural disaster. This requires an infrastructure
	that is different in concept and capability at a number of fundamental
	levels. Earlier technologies are based on what the technology can
	do, and not what the business needs to do. This fundamental change
	of perspective is what IBM term ``On Demand Computing{''}. To evolve
	and apply an on ``On Demand{''} computing model in software engineering
	a software architect must incorporate an engineering strategy that
	encompasses the underlying development process, methods and tools.
	This underlying strategy is often referred to as a Software Engineering
	Paradigm. Software engineering process and architecture models are
	generally chosen based on the nature of the challenge and the application,
	the methods and tools used, and the control and deliverables that
	are required. As a consequence, the software engineering model typically
	adopted in software development projects has direct implications
	for all aspects of the project's end-to-end life cycle, including
	development, function test, system test engineering, performance
	engineering, product enablement/support incremental maintenance releases,
	and so on. This paper debates the need for software engineering teams
	to consider hybrid process and architecture model decisions in the
	context of motivating an optimal ``on demand{''} enterprise application
	development agenda. Consequently, we assert that evolving an ``on
	demand{''} software engineering paradigm implies new rules for software
	development organizations, where all engineering capabilities will
	need to support integration of business decisions, processes and
	methods. Motivating an ``on demand{''} engineering methodology to
	derive parallel competencies will promote new rules in all aspects
	of engagement and planning, and represents the next phase in which
	software development teams move beyond simply integrating their processes
	to actually being able to sense and respond to fluctuating conditions
	so to provide organization-wide capabilities in an ``on demand{''}
	way. First, an attempt is made to understand the essence and evolution
	of the computing paradigm. Second, the rationale for evolving an
	``on demand{''} enterprise application development engineering model
	is explored. Third, pertinent software engineering architectural
	concerns are assessed, after which we explore key software engineering
	process methodologies that need to be considered prior to planning
	an optimal software engineering process paradigm. Finally, we shall
	explore considerations for evolving a modified software engineering
	agenda in the context of an architecturally biased process model
	framework.},

	reality (VR) models and approaches to cultural history, for teaching
	and research. It is based on an ongoing project undertaken by 'Cultures
	Anglophones et Technologies de l'Information' at Paris-Sorbonne:
	'Montmartre in the jazz age', a model of Montmartre in the late 1920s,
	when African-American musicians brought jazz to cabarets. Integrating
	it into the curriculum modifies the research/teaching interaction:
	it involves students in projects in progress; it encourages them
	to undertake interdisciplinary studies, involving computing skills
	and research in topography or music history. The issues that arise
	in the authoring of the project are a contribution to the problematics
	of cultural history; modelling the Montmartre environment from early
	documents (maps, photographs, which have to be edited with specialized
	software) shows how relative and incomplete they are - and thus how
	relative and composite our own modelling is. This composite character
	is in keeping with the 'spirit of place' of a multicultural area;
	VR is an elaborate structure, starting from a 3D model, with interior
	and exterior views, wireframes and textures; the medium is suited
	to the message: the recreation of a complex environment of spaces
	and subspaces throwing into focus contact points between French traditional
	songs and American jazz. The VR projects underline issues in the
	humanities; involving students increases their awareness of new problematics.
	The present article shows how new methods in humanities computing,
	in the field of visualization, alter and enrich humanities disciplines.
	It documents the authoring of a VR model, and the introduction of
	an Information Technology research project into the university teaching
	process: 'Montmartre in the jazz age', a multidisciplinary humanities
	adventure involving a digital reconstruction of part of this famous
	Paris area, the 'Lapin Agile' cabaret in the first instance. It argues
	that the involvement of research students in such projects not only
	gives them IT skills, but also adds to their critical understanding
	of humanities issues. © The Author. Published by Oxford University

	must wait for the vendor to complete a lengthy development cycle,
	which, when complete, may miss the market window for the software
	or fail to adequately address other needs of these stakeholders.
	Agile development methods, as practiced across geographically diverse

	information provided about the methodology leading to system implementation.
	We propose here an 'agile' business rule design framework (BRDF)
	supporting both the design of alerts for the validation of drug prescriptions
	and the incorporation of the end user into the design process. Methods:
	We analyzed the unified process (UP) design life cycle and defined
	the activities, subactivities, actors and UML artifacts that could
	be used to enhance the agility of the proposed framework. We then
	applied the proposed framework to two different sets of data in the
	context of the Georges Pompidou University Hospital (HEGP) CIS. Results:
	We introduced two new subactivities into UP: business rule specification
	and business rule instantiation activity. The pharmacist made an
	effective contribution to five of the eight BRDF design activities.
	Validation of the two new subactivities was effected in the context
	of drug dosage adaption to the patients' clinical and biological
	contexts. Pilot experiment shows that business rules modeled with
	BRDF and implemented as an alert system triggered an alert for 5824
	of the 71,413 prescriptions considered (8.16%). Conclusion: A business
	rule design framework approach meets one of the strategic objectives
	for decision support design by taking into account three important
	criteria posing a particular challenge to system designers: 1) business
	processes, 2) knowledge modeling of the context of application, and
	3) the agility of the various design steps. © Schattauer 2011.},

	and overriding, in case of foreseen as well as unforeseen changes

	that an agile workflow system should address is Business Process
	(BP) monitoring. This consists in properly highlighting and organizing
	non-compliances and adaptations with respect to the default process
	schema. Such an activity can be the starting point for other very
	critical tasks, such as quality assessment and process reengineering.
	In this paper, we introduce an automated support to BP monitoring,
	which exploits the Case-based Reasoning (CBR) methodology. CBR is
	particularly well suited for managing exceptional situations, and
	has been proposed in the literature for process change reuse and
	workflow adaptation support. Our work extends these functionalities
	by retrieving traces of process execution similar to the current
	one, which can then be automatically clustered. Retrieval and clustering
	results can provide support both to end users, in the process instance
	execution phase, and to process engineers, in (formal) process quality
	evaluation and long term process schema redefinition. Our approach
	in practice is illustrated by means of a case study in the field

  abstract = {The development of Web applications is an important focus of the modern
	information enabled organization - whether the Web application development
	is in-house, outsourced, or purchased as `commercial-off-the-shelf
	(COTS) software. Traditionally Web application development has been
	delivered via the dominant waterfall system. The waterfall system
	relies upon well-defined governance structures, linear phases, gating,
	and extensive reporting and sign-off documentation. An increasing
	number of development stakeholders criticise the waterfall system
	for web application development. The criticisms include a disproportionate
	focus on governance and process at the direct expense of flexibility
	and, most importantly, reduced productivity. One consequence of these
	criticisms is the increasing adoption of Web application development
	via agile-system methods. This agile-system approach centres upon
	smaller design teams, fewer development phases, and shorter development
	time tables. This case study examines the implementation of the agile-system
	approach as used by a Small-to-Medium Enterprise (SME) software developer.
	The case study data collection involves interviews and observations
	across three different SME sources: project managers, Web application
	programmers, and customers. The case study analysis synthesises the
	experiences of these managers, programmers and customers to produce
	an overall assessment of the usefulness of Web application delivery
	via agile-system methods. The major conclusions from the case study
	are that a `defaulf agile-system approach may be tailored or fine-tuned
	to fit an individual developer's software process. This tailoring
	is based upon the developer's assessment of best practice from the
	overall agile-system methodology. This tailoring, however, delivers
	a software development process that exhibits efficiencies and risks.
	The efficiencies include a more fulfilling role for each development
	team member, greater richness and continuity in design, a simple
	management system that delivers key information on a timely basis
	to all stake-holders, and increased business and technical quality
	within the delivered application. The risks pivot upon experience
	levels, skills levels, and the quality of interaction within - and
	between - both the development team and customer organization.},

	software development projects. This paper will present the findings
	of a case study on the applicability and effectiveness of Scrum in
	such projects. We first briefly summarized the findings on what aspects
	of Scrum were both successfully and poorly adopted (applicability
	perspective) and what aspects of Scrum were key factors to improve
	or deteriorate the quality of the products in terms of bug rates,
	development time and costs (effectiveness perspective). Based on
	literature reviews of small group research, we also analyzed the
	effectiveness of Scrum from the perspectives of social facilitation,
	social loafing, and group motivational gains. In addition, we identified
	five core characteristics of Scrum and analyzed the relationships
	among them. Finally, this paper provides some suggestions to help
	organizations overcome obstacles expected in adopting the Scrum method
	as a future development tool.},

  note = {cited By (since 1996)0},
  abstract = {Virtualization technology is now widely adopted in cloud computing
	to support heterogeneous and dynamic workload. The scheduler in a
	virtual machine monitor (VMM) plays an important role in allocating
	resources. However, the type of applications in virtual machines
	(VM) is unknown to the scheduler, and I/O-intensive and CPU-intensive
	applications are treated the same. This makes virtual systems unable
	to take full advantage of high performance networks such as 10-Gigabit
	Ethernet. In this paper, we review the SR-IOV networking solution
	and show by experiment that the current credit scheduler in Xen does
	not utilize high performance networks efficiently. For this reason,
	we propose a novel scheduling model with two optimizations to eliminate
	the bottleneck caused by scheduler. In this model, guest domains
	are divided into I/O-intensive domains and CPU-intensive domains
	according to their monitored behaviour. I/O-intensive domains can
	obtain extra credits that CPU-intensive domains are willing to share.
	Besides, the total available credits is adjusted agilely to accelerate
	the I/O responsiveness. Our experimental evaluation with benchmarks
	shows that the new scheduling model improves bandwidth even when
	the system's load is very high. © 2012 IEEE.},

	and quantitative suggestions to understand the ways to change the
	software process to improve its quality, or the ways to achieve specific
	organisation's needs. In many cases, however, such understanding
	has to be done without affecting the actual environment. To this
	purpose, this paper introduces the use of process simulators for
	validation testing. To be effective, however, simulators must combine
	the ability to sustain the complexity of the modelling problem with
	the so-called dynamic estimation capability, that is the capability
	of representing the dynamics of the simulated process. To achieve
	such objectives, the introduced simulator is based on the association
	of three conventional modelling methods (analytical, continuous and
	discrete-event) into a unique hybrid multi-level new model, called
	dynamic capability model (DCM). The paper applies DCM in the context
	of a waterfall-based software process to study the effects of three
	different quality assurance management policies on given process
	quality attributes, as effort, delivery time, productivity, rework
	percentage, and product quality. The verification of the simulator
	representativeness is also performed by reproducing empirically known
	facts in the process behaviour. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All

	the introduction of a new software development methodology in a software
	project team. The failure to adopt the new methodology is seen as
	a failure to learn by the team. This paper posits that learning is
	more than the cognitive process of acquiring a new skill; learning
	also involves changes in behaviours, attitudes and opinions. As methodology
	adoption involves changes to a team's activities, values and norms,
	this study investigates the introduction of an Agile method by a
	software team as a learning experience. Researchers use the concepts
	of single- and double-loop learning to explain how social actors
	learn to (a) perforin tasks efficiently and (b) decide on the best
	task to perform. The theory of triple-loop learning explains how
	a learning process can be ineffective; accordingly, it is employed
	to examine why the introduction of a new methodology was ineffective
	in the team studied. The theory illustrates how power factors influence
	learning. This study focuses on one specific power factor - the power
	inherent in the desire for cohesion and conformity within a team.
	Ineffective decision-making and related actions occur because of
	the desire to conform among group members; this was shown as the
	cause of ineffective learning in the software team. The findings
	illustrate how the values inherent in the Agile methodologies, primarily
	the desire for cohesion within the team, ultimately led to the failure
	of the team to learn.},

	pillars of the wider agile software development process. The user
	stories form a set of central work products that determine the software

	of user stories is kept as simple as possible. Traditionally, user
	stories are hand written on index cards as they are easy to store,

	However, virtually all other work products of an application development
	team are in electronic format, and agile software development is
	increasingly being adopted by teams working from remote locations.
	In these circumstances distributed development teams look to software

  abstract = {Cognitive radios are becoming the technological foundation for efficiently
	managing the scarcity of wireless spectrum, fulfilling various QoS
	demands and allowing different networks to coexist. Cognition and
	spectrum agility in MAC protocols require adaptability and close
	PHY-MAC interaction. Classically, MAC protocols have been implemented
	in hardware, which gives a limited possibility for reconfiguration
	and customization. Recently, software based MAC implementations have
	emerged although a close hardware-software co-design is typically
	required to keep the time critical operations in ASICs or FPGAs.
	We introduce a MAC development framework for enabling fast composition
	of MAC protocols, which are best fitted to the application requirements,
	communication capabilities of the radio, and current spectrum regulations
	and policies. We decompose MAC protocols into their basic functionalities
	which are perceived as building blocks and are partitioned across
	hardware/software. Our framework allows on-the-fly realization of
	the envisioned MAC protocol through wiring of these fundamental components.
	By exposing extended metadata and hardware functionalities for the
	MAC implementation through our granular components, together with
	the support for run-time re-configuration, spectrum agile and cognitive
	MAC solutions can be easily realized. In this paper, we describe
	the design rationale and implementation details of our framework
	on WARP boards. We show through experimental evaluation that the
	framework provides flexible means for prototyping different reconfigurable
	cognitive and spectrum agile MAC protocols.},

	This loss produces a semantic gap between what is desired and what

	behavior-driven context -- and by the conceptual model. This paper
	presents an interactive approach to the agile requirements modeling,
	thus fostering greater consistency between the artifacts of the scenarios
	and the conceptual model. This consistency is ensured by using a
	mind model specification which will serve as a basis for transforming
	the definitions of the scenario and generating a conceptual model
	represented by a UML class diagram. The mind model represents the

	Our solution is lightweight in terms of performance overhead and

	into a collection of smaller teams and each subteam should be responsible
	for one or more subsystems, enabling them to work as a small agile
	team responsible for delivering working software on a timely basis.},

	considered as the greatest strength of Genesys. Agile Development
	Environment for Programming and Testing (ADEPT) is our contribution
	towards supporting the XP methodology by adopting the Eclipse platform
	along with its associated tools and frameworks within Genesys Solutions.
	It aimed to teach good software practices in Genesys to support XP
	by providing a software development life cycle management tool that
	will encompass the best practices of XP. It comprises of tools based
	on the principles of XP such as story cards, system metaphor, estimations,
	testing and quality assurance. ADEPT was the result of the IBM Eclipse
	Innovation 2004 awarded to the University of Sheffield. Also, based
	on the previous year's performance and more innovative ideas to implement
	more principles of XP we have been awarded another grant under the
	IBM Eclipse Innovation 2005 programme. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg

	key technology (heritage hardware) and created a large paradigm shift
	from traditional spacecraft development. The insertion of new technologies
	and methods in space hardware has long been a problem due to long
	build times, the desire to use heritage hardware, and lack of effective
	process. The role of momentum in the innovative process can be exploited
	to tackle ongoing technology disruptions and allowing risk interactions
	to be mitigated in a disciplined manner. Examples of how these concepts
	were used during the MBD program will be delineated. Maintaining
	project momentum was essential to assess the constant non recurring
	technological challenges which needed to be retired rapidly from
	the engineering risk liens. Development never slowed due to tactical
	assessment of the hardware with the adoption of the SCRUM technique.
	We adapted this concept as a representation of mitigation of technical
	risk while allowing for design freeze later in the program's development
	cycle. By using Agile Systems Engineering and Management techniques

  abstract = {The introduction of software technology in a life-dependent environment
	requires the development team to execute a process that ensures a
	high level of software reliability and correctness. Despite their
	popularity, agile methods are generally assumed to be inappropriate
	as a process family in these environments due to their lack of emphasis
	on documentation, traceability, and other formal techniques. Agile
	methods, notably Scrum, favor empirical process control, or small
	constant adjustments in a tight feedback loop. This paper challenges
	the assumption that agile methods are inappropriate for safety-critical
	software development. Agile methods are flexible enough to encourage
	the right amount of ceremony; therefore if safety-critical systems
	require greater emphasis on activities, such as formal specification
	and requirements management, then an agile process will include these
	as necessary activities. Furthermore, agile methods focus more on
	continuous process management and code-level quality than classic
	software engineering process models. We present our experiences on
	the image-guided surgical toolkit (IGSTK) project as a backdrop.
	IGSTK is an open source software project employing agile practices
	since 2004. We started with the assumption that a lighter process
	is better, focused on evolving code, and only adding process elements
	as the need arose. IGSTK has been adopted by teaching hospitals and
	research labs, and used for clinical trials. Agile methods have matured
	since the academic community suggested almost a decade ago that they
	were not suitable for safety-critical systems; we present our experiences
	as a case study for renewing the discussion. Copyright (C) 2011 John

	that relies on strong collaboration and automation to keep pace with
	dynamic environments. We have successfully used agile development
	approaches to create and maintain biomedical software, including
	software for bioinformatics. This paper reports on a qualitative
	study of our experiences using these methods. Results: We have found
	that agile methods are well suited to the exploratory and iterative
	nature of scientific inquiry. They provide a robust framework for
	reproducing scientific results and for developing clinical support
	systems. The agile development approach also provides a model for
	collaboration between software engineers and researchers. We present
	our experience using agile methodologies in projects at six different
	biomedical software development organizations. The organizations
	include academic, commercial and government development teams, and
	included both bioinformatics and clinical support applications. We
	found that agile practices were a match for the needs of our biomedical
	projects and contributed to the success of our organizations. Conclusion:
	We found that the agile development approach was a good fit for our
	organizations, and that these practices should be applicable and
	valuable to other biomedical software development efforts. Although
	we found differences in how agile methods were used, we were also
	able to identify a set of core practices that were common to all
	of the groups, and that could be a focus for others seeking to adopt

  abstract = {Context: Many organizations have started to deploy agile methods,
	but so far there exist only a few studies on organization-wide transformations.
	Are agile methods here to stay? Some claim that agile software development
	methods are in the mainstream adoption phase in the software industry,
	while others hope that those are a passing fad. The assumption here
	is that if agile would not provide real improvement, adopters would
	be eager at first but turn pessimistic after putting it into practice.
	Objective: Despite the growing amount of anecdotal evidence on the
	success of agile methods across a wide range of different real-life
	development settings, scientific studies remain scarce. Even less
	is known about the perception of the impacts of agile transformation
	when it is deployed in a very large software development environment,
	and whether agile methods are here to stay. This study aims to fill
	that gap by providing evidence from a large-scale agile transformation
	within Nokia. While we have yet to confirm these findings with solid
	quantitative data, we believe that the perception of the impacts
	already pinpoints the direction of the impacts of large-scale agile
	transformation. Method: The data were collected using a questionnaire.
	The population of the study contains more than 1000 respondents in
	seven different countries in Europe, North America, and Asia. Results:
	The results reveal that most respondents agree on all accounts with
	the generally claimed benefits of agile methods. These benefits include
	higher satisfaction, a feeling of effectiveness, increased quality
	and transparency, increased autonomy and happiness, and earlier detection
	of defects. Finally, 60% of respondents would not like to return
	to the old way of working. Conclusion: While the perception of the
	impact of agile methods is predominantly positive, several challenge
	areas were discovered. However, based on this study, agile methods
	are here to stay. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	represent highly dynamic environments in which performance and efficiency
	can be seriously impacted by changes in environmental conditions.
	This is especially significant where the run-time configuration has
	been determined statically, either at compilation time or at the
	start of execution. This paper introduces the concept of agile parallel
	processing in which the application manages several aspects of its
	own run-time behaviour, including deployment granularity. This approach
	reduces the emphasis on the preconfiguration of components, and relies
	instead on inbuilt learning and discovery capabilities. To facilitate
	investigation into the extent to which a self-managing approach can
	be beneficial to parallel processing, an experimental framework has
	been developed. The framework provides a range of services such as
	dynamic worker discovery and performance calibration, and policy-controlled
	facilities such as resource management and adaptation to suit environmental
	conditions. The framework integrates these services with the parallel
	application code. The operation and performance of policy-based dynamic

  journal = {BMC Research Notes},
  year = {2011},

  note = {cited By (since 1996) 1},
  abstract = {Background: In bioinformatics projects, scientific workflow systems
	are widely used to manage computational procedures. Full-featured
	workflow systems have been proposed to fulfil the demand for workflow
	management. However, such systems tend to be over-weighted for actual
	bioinformatics practices. We realize that quick deployment of cutting-edge
	software implementing advanced algorithms and data formats, and continuous
	adaptation to changes in computational resources and the environment
	are often prioritized in scientific workflow management. These features
	have a greater affinity with the agile software development method
	through iterative development phases after trial and error. Here,
	we show the application of a scientific workflow system Pwrake to
	bioinformatics workflows. Pwrake is a parallel workflow extension
	of Ruby's standard build tool Rake, the flexibility of which has
	been demonstrated in the astronomy domain. Therefore, we hypothesize
	that Pwrake also has advantages in actual bioinformatics workflows.
	Findings. We implemented the Pwrake workflows to process next generation
	sequencing data using the Genomic Analysis Toolkit (GATK) and Dindel.
	GATK and Dindel workflows are typical examples of sequential and
	parallel workflows, respectively. We found that in practice, actual
	scientific workflow development iterates over two phases, the workflow
	definition phase and the parameter adjustment phase. We introduced
	separate workflow definitions to help focus on each of the two developmental
	phases, as well as helper methods to simplify the descriptions. This
	approach increased iterative development efficiency. Moreover, we
	implemented combined workflows to demonstrate modularity of the GATK
	and Dindel workflows. Conclusions: Pwrake enables agile management
	of scientific workflows in the bioinformatics domain. The internal
	domain specific language design built on Ruby gives the flexibility
	of rakefiles for writing scientific workflows. Furthermore, readability
	and maintainability of rakefiles may facilitate sharing workflows
	among the scientific community. Workflows for GATK and Dindel are

	be investigated. This paper provides an initial analysis of agile
	practices in the context of software development for the European
	railway sector, regulated by the EN 50128 standard. The study complements
	previous studies on the use of agile methods in other regulated domains.
	A systematic mapping between EN 50128 requirements and agile practices
	showed that all practices support some objectives of the standard.
	Important supporting features recognized were focus on simple design,
	test automation, coding standards, continuous integration and validation.
	However, several problematic areas were also identified, including
	vague requirement analysis and change management. Most agile practices
	must be adapted to suit regulated software development and this analysis
	outlines a subset of the required changes.},

	investment in (i) designing a common set of core-assets and (ii)

	certain accuracy, SPLE has proved significant improvements. However,

	Agile Software Development (ASD) may be an alternative, as agile

	manage reusability and variability across the products from the same

	we introduce the agile Robot Development (aRD) concept, which is
	a flexible, pragmatic and distributed software design to support
	and simplify the development of complex mechatronic and robotic systems.
	It gives easy access to scalable computing performance (even in hard

	links. We discuss design considerations and an implementation of
	this concept and demonstrate its performance with first applications.

	More and more software companies however have a desire to adopt agile

	For market reasons the company has to comply the US Food and Drug

	Systems Methodology how well the development process combines these

	to the FDA standard, but at the same time many of the genuine qualities
	of an agile process have been maintained. From this case study we

	effective solution for dealing with the growing complexity of software
	and handling competitive needs of software organizations. They also
	share common goals, such as improving productivity, reducing time-to-market,

	There has been growing interest in whether the integration of Agile

	the state-of-the-art in Agile SPL approaches, while identifying gaps
	in current research and synthesizing available evidence. It also
	provides a basis for a deeper understanding of the issues involved
	in the integration of Agile and SPL. Method: A mapping study was
	undertaken to analyze the relation between Agile and SPL methods.
	A set of four research questions were defined in which the 32 primary
	studies were evaluated. Results: This study provides insights into
	the integration of Agile and SPL approaches, it identifies the current
	gaps in the research, synthesize the available evidence and propose
	specific Agile methods and practices for integration in SPL. Conclusions:
	In general, few studies describe the underlying Agile principles
	being adopted by proposed Agile SPL solutions. The most common Agile
	practices proposed by the studies came from the XP and Scrum methods,
	particularly in the pro-active SPL strategy. We identify certain
	Agile methods that are being overlooked by the Agile SPL community,

  abstract = {A supply chain (SC) is a network of supplier, factories, warehouse,
	distribution centers, retailers, and customers, through which raw
	materials are acquired, transformed, produced, and delivered to the
	customers. As a complex network of suppliers, factories, warehouses,
	distributors, and retailers, the highly effective and efficient operations
	of a SC depend on the speedily moving of information flows and material
	flows. The rapid advances in information technology (IT) have always
	resulted in innovation, such as the Internet, that is terms of its
	potential as a channel for collecting, transmitting and storing information.
	As is well-known, the emergence of Internet has made a significant
	impact on the rapid growth of Internet-based information transfer
	between companies, their suppliers, and their customers. The Internet
	has emerged as an effective means of driving information integration
	and sharing for a supply chain, as well as has supported various
	coordination mechanisms across a supply chain. To make decisions
	promptly and to accelerate material flows via the integration and
	sharing of information flows improve the effectiveness and efficiency

	material flows and the information flows in a supply chain because
	of the information flows always can not reflect the wave of material
	flows real-timely, as well as it is impossible to understand the
	process of a supply chain execution real-timely. Being the next generation

	implications of aligning the organizational values embedded in a
	systems development approach (e.g. agile) with the organizational
	values of project team members. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative
	case study approach is used to examine systems development project
	teams at three organizations, each using a development approach that
	incorporates different organizational value dimensions. Interviews
	were conducted with developers, systems analysts, and managers regarding
	their systems development experiences. A structured coding of the
	interview transcripts was then completed to enable analysis of value
	dimensions. Findings: By comparing the dominant values between the
	project teams and their development approach, varying degrees of
	alignment were identified. Where alignment is high, perceptions of
	the systems development process are associated with satisfaction
	and enthusiasm; where alignment is low, perceptions focus on frustration
	and discontent. Research limitations/implications: Based on the study's
	findings, four propositions pertaining to the antecedents and implications
	of IS values alignment are outlined for examination in future research.
	Practical implications: The findings from this study can aid managers
	who are considering the use of a new systems development approach
	or evaluating the effectiveness of their current approach. By determining
	the degree of information systems (IS) values alignment, organizations
	may be able to customize their development approach to be more consistent
	with the team's values, in order to minimize negative development
	process perceptions and increase project performance. Originality/value:
	This research extends past studies of organizational values and alignment
	by introducing the concept of IS values alignment. © Emerald Group

	But how well do current scientific software development processes
	match the practices found in agile development methods, and what
	are the effects of using agile practices in such processes? In order
	to investigate this, we conduct a literature review, focusing on
	evaluating the agility present in a selection of scientific software
	projects. Both projects with intentionally agile practices and projects
	with a certain degree of agile elements are taken into consideration.
	In the agility assessment, we define and utilize an agile mapping
	chart. The elements of the mapping chart are based on Scrum and XP,
	thus covering two of the most prominent agile reference models. We
	compared the findings of the literature review to results of a previously
	conducted survey. The comparison indicates that scientific software
	development projects adopting agile practices perceive their testing
	to be better than average. No difference to average projects was
	perceived regarding requirements-related activities. Future work

	to adopt a selected subset of principles and practices based on their

	More specifically, every organization or team implements a customized
	agile method, tailored to better accommodate its needs. However,
	the extent to which a customized method supports the organizational
	objectives, i.e. the `goodness' of that method, is questionable.
	Existing agile assessment approaches focus on comparative analyses,

	a structured, systematic, and comprehensive approach to assessing
	the `goodness' of agile methods. We examine an agile method based
	on (1) its adequacy, (2) the capability of the organization to support
	the adopted principles and practices specified by the method, and
	(3) the method's effectiveness. We propose the Objectives, Principles
	and Practices (OPP) Framework to guide our assessment. The Framework
	identifies (1) objectives of the agile philosophy, (2) principles
	that support the objectives, (3) practices that are reflective of
	the principles, (4) linkages among the objectives, principles and
	practices, and (5) indicators for assessing the extent to which an

	e-procurement system in which agent technology is applied to deal
	with the internal and external uncertainties. Through the collaboration
	and interaction between different agents, the architecture that we
	propose can enhance the flexibility to handle unexpected exceptions,
	thus leading to agile procurement management. To valid the feasibility
	of our approach, a case study has been conducted to investigate how
	our agents collaborate to manage the inventory failure exception
	which occurs in restaurant e-procurement. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

	planning and scheduling activities in order to enhance the responsiveness
	of manufacturing systems and acts as a means to achieve agile manufacturing.
	The agents in this system collaborate with each other to obtain an
	integrated plan and schedule that carries the minimum production
	cost while satisfying the promised delivery due dates. The agent
	co-ordination protocol used is based on a contact-net bidding protocol,
	where the bidding process is carried out iteratively based on a currency
	scheme. In the scheme jobs announced to the agents are assigned with
	virtual currency values which have an effect on agent bidding decisions.
	These values are iteratively optimised with the purpose of searching
	for an optimum bid that satisfies due dates and gives the lowest
	production cost. To optimise the currency values at each iteration,
	a tabu search algorithm is proposed. The multi-agent system has been
	implemented on a Java platform. A test case and the results obtained
	will be discussed in this paper.},

  abstract = {Purpose: This paper seeks to describe the application of the Agile
	software development approach to rapidly develop and deploy a variety
	of innovative IT applications. Design/methodology/approach: The Agile
	approach is flexible and iterative with continuous feedback and constant
	communication. It is also marked by frequent and short delivery schedules.
	An Agile team of staff and students was formed for different projects,
	and visual tools were used to show process and progress. Team members
	were also co-located (situated in the same space), a key element
	that allowed faster and direct communication. Within the Agile framework,
	the Crystal Clear methodology was selected, which is based on team
	size and criticality of the application to develop the workflow and
	iterative processes. Findings: The Agile approach is particularly
	suited to innovation development and creative teams for rapid development
	of products, services, and technology. However, its acceptance is
	dependent on organizational culture and nature of application. Research
	limitations/implications: As a next step, it would be useful to test
	the Agile approach in an innovative application that is on a larger
	scale than six team members and with a different level of criticality.
	Practical implications: Flexibility and adaptability are needed in
	managing the development of IT innovations and applications as they
	vary in size and complexity. The flexible and iterative Agile approach
	provided the framework to develop and implement these projects despite
	the small staff size. Originality/value: There is little in the professional
	literature on software development and project management approaches
	for small teams. The Agile approach would be of interest to an IT
	unit or library with limited staff resources and interested in a
	lightweight framework to develop and deploy innovative projects.

	Agile Methods. Design/methodology/approach - Starting from the simple
	observation that the original introduction of Course Management Systems
	to support online learning was ad hoc and evolutionary, rather than
	planned at an enterprise level, the paper points to the conflict
	between, and offers a solution for, open and decentralized resources

	a logic to decentralization, a number of managerial strategies to
	improve agility are provided that address the changing nature of
	the university from one fundamentally designed to control, to one

	Findings - It is found that many components of the university including
	teaching, learning content, learning design, content development
	and management, and core infrastructure are shifting from centralized
	to decentralized models, while current management and governance
	practices remain centralized resulting in lagging development and

	Shorter re-fracture cycle time increases the flexibility of mask

	to its optimum. Preliminary results demonstrate promising benefits
	in MDP cycle time reduction and writer dispatching flexibility improvement.
	The agile MDP can save up to 40% of re-fracture cycle time. OASIS
	(Open Artwork System Interchange Standard) was proposed to address
	the GDSII file size explosion problem. However, OASIS has yet to
	gain wide acceptance in the mask industry. The authors envision OASIS
	adoption by the mask industry as a three-phase process and identify
	key issues of each phase from the mask manufacturer's perspective.
	As a long-term MDP flow reengineering project, an agile MDP and writer
	dispatching approach based on OASIS is proposed. The paper describes
	the results of an extensive evaluation on OASIS performance compared
	to that of GDSII, both original GDSII and post-OPC GDSII files. The

	of Henna AIDS Chinese medicine prevention and cure at the same time,
	we develop AIDS traditional Chinese medicine clinical information
	management system.[Methods]Employ unified modeling language (UML)
	as the modeling tool of the system. Based on Rational unified process
	(RUP) development, ID number as patients' recognition number. [Procedure]
	According to the characteristics of AIDS TCM clinical syndrome, this
	article has deeply introduced the application of UML in the analysis
	and design of software, it also used iterative type development process
	of use case drive, and explained the system analysis and design process
	in detail at the same time. Combined with an instance of the UML
	diagrams, we introduced the application of UML software modeling
	in detail. [Results]: Combined with nation TCM treatment AIDS projects
	and Henan Province AIDS TCM prevention experience, the management
	system frame and model of the clinical syndrome of AIDS in Chinese
	traditional medicine have been constructed. According to the above
	model, we built the information management system of TCM clinical
	syndrome of AIDS comprehensive prevention and control. [Conclusion]UML
	modeling can speed up the development speed and improve system reliability.
	We have put traditional Chinese medicine syndromes basic information
	data of 1654 AIDS patients into the system, and have made the corresponding
	statistical analysis in view of the investigation data. We have provided
	practical and efficient work platform among doctors, patients and
	scientific researchers. The systematization and standardization of
	patients management have been realized, the dynamic management of
	information of patients' each stage has been realized, which will
	bring a beneficial effect on the systematical treatment of AIDS.

	in the Middle East. Secondary issues examined are: strategic factors
	facing the company examined in the case study; the B2B business model;
	privacy and security issues of e-commerce; and new business strategies
	for B2B. This case has a difficulty level of four and is best utilized
	in a senior level Strategic Management/E-Marketing course. Depending
	upon the depth of analysis, the case can be taught in three to six
	hours and requires a preparation time of three to six hours. Case
	Synopsis: The introduction of Internet use and the resulting growth
	in e-commerce has changed the service industry in the 21st century.
	These factors have led to changes in online transactions and have
	introduced new, Internet-only services companies, forcing traditional
	service institutions to quickly develop and implement an e-commerce
	strategy. The current case analyzes strategic issues surrounding
	e-business at Bewari, a B2B company established in June 2000 that
	allows companies in the Arabian Gulf region to buy and sell goods
	and services online. Bewari is a hypothetical company. At the request
	of the real company's management, its name is kept confidential since
	Bewari did not want to disclose its operations to its competitors.
	This case study is chosen since the Arabian Gulf region is unique
	in terms of culture, tradition, business practices, human and organizational
	values compared to those in developed economies. Most of the economies
	in the region are oil-rich. Business development practices in one
	economy in a particular sector are rapidly imitated by businesses
	in the neighboring economies in the region. The economies in the
	region form a major trade bloc of major importance to neighboring
	European and Asian economies. Bewari has chosen to create and maintain
	the highest standard B2B customer service and trading facilities
	in the Middle East. The case shows that Bewari: is an ideal partner
	for helping companies reach new markets in real time is agile enough
	to respond to fast changing market opportunities provides innovative
	online B2B services, enabling B2B firms to extend their reach and
	enhance their competitive standing, and integrates supply chain.
	Nevertheless, growing pains have ensued. From its inception, Bewari
	has given access to the resources and culture thought necessary to
	allow it to succeed. While Bewari was given the right resources and
	freedom to succeed, it was asked to do so within an organization
	incapable of producing the desired product. Bewari faces pressure
	from its stakeholders to improve performance and maximize synergies
	from recent alliances. In addition, decisions and options regarding
	Bewari must be taken into consideration as part of Bewari's overall
	strategy. © 2009 by the DreamCatchers Group.},

	lenses (communication, coordination, and control), we first investigate
	how and where communication and coordination processes between different
	elements start, and how management teams can control them. In addition,
	social factor theories (social facilitation, social loafing, and
	group motivational gain) and theory of complex adaptive system are
	introduced to explain core practices of and highlight their implications
	in Scrum. Finally, we present several important issues on how to
	optimally manage Scrum teams, how to extend Scrum practices to large-scale
	and global software development, and how to incorporate pair programming

	possible. An ASC needs to adopt the most appropriate supply chain
	structure and assign the most suitable order quantities to the most

	stage, an ANP methodology is applied to calculate the priorities
	of different criteria for partner selection. Secondly, using these

	apply an iterative or agile development model into global software

	errors in the student's code, and then report points lost due to
	mistakes, and give suitable pieces of advice to correct or improve
	the code immediately. With automated testing the students can check
	the validity of their code by themselves. This means that the instructor
	can concentrate on mentoring the students who are most in need of
	support and advice. Our proposed method also ensures the evaluation
	of assignments to be fair and strict by applying various well-behaved
	input patterns based on standard software testing techniques while
	saving time. With our testing framework, students are continuously
	aware of their progress under a game-like environment, and thereby

  abstract = {Following the wired network virtualization, virtualization of wireless
	networks becomes the next step aiming to provide network or infrastructure
	providers with the ability to manage and control their networks in
	a more dynamic fashion. The benefit of the wireless mobile network
	virtualization is a more agile business model where virtual mobile
	network operators (MNOs) can request and thus pay physical MNOs in
	a more pay-as-you-use manner. This paper presents some resource allocation
	algorithms for joint network virtualization and resource allocation
	of wireless networks. The overall algorithm involves the following
	two major processes: firstly, to virtualize a physical wireless network
	into multiple slices, each representing a virtual network, and secondly,
	to carry out physical resource allocation within each virtual network
	(or slice). In particular, the paper adopts orthogonal frequency
	division multiplexing (OFDM) as its physical layer to achieve more
	efficient resource utilization. Therefore, the resource allocation
	is conducted in terms of sub-carriers. Although the motivation and
	algorithm design are based on IEEE 802.16 or WiMAX networks, the
	principle and algorithmic essence are also applicable to other OFDM
	access-based wireless networks. The aim was to achieve the following
	design goals: virtual network isolation and resource efficiency.
	The latter is measured in terms of network throughput and packet
	delivery ratio. The simulation results show that the aforementioned
	goals have been achieved. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {This article presents an empirical ground-motion prediction model
	(attenuation relation) for inelastic (as opposed to elastic) spectral
	displacement (S-di) for ground motions without forward directivity
	effects. It is a function of two earthquake parameters, moment magnitude
	(M-w) and the closest distance to rupture (R-rup), and two bilinear
	oscillator parameters, an undamped elastic period (T) and a yield
	displacement (d(y)). The d(y) is introduced via the predicted median
	strength-reduction factor ((R) over cap), a proxy for the ratio of
	elastic spectral displacement (S-de) to d(y), which is identical
	with the familiar strength-reduction factor (R). The proxy recognizes
	that (R) over cap can only be estimated indirectly because it implicitly
	contains the random variable, S-de, which cannot be known a priori;
	therefore, the median estimate or predicted median ((S) over cap
	(de)) from a conventional (elastic) ground-motion prediction model
	is used instead to calculate (R) over cap = (S) over cap (de)/d(y).
	For enhanced generality, the inelastic spectral displacement prediction
	model here is based on a ratio concept, that is, the total model
	is a (any) conventional elastic prediction model coupled with a new
	inelastic displacement ratio prediction model, with proper statistical
	correlation between the two. We empirically consider the dependence
	of this ratio on source and path effects (i.e., M-w and R-rup), and
	find that M-w is significant, but R-rup is not. The resulting prediction
	model can easily be added to existing probabilistic seismic-hazard
	analysis (PSHA) software packages with only one extra structure-specific
	parameter, dy of the oscillator. In practical engineering applications,
	this will likely have been estimated from the conventional static
	pushover analysis of the multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) structure
	under consideration. The resulting PSHA product is a hazard curve
	for S-di, the inelastic spectral displacement of a nonlinear oscillator.
	Such a curve can provide a more direct hazard-based target displacement
	for nonlinear static procedures (Federal Emergency Management Agency
	{[}FEMA] 356, 2000) and/or a basic input function for new probabilistic
	seismic-demand analyses that is based on S-di (as opposed to S-de)
	as an efficient and sufficient intensity measure. This new attenuation
	relationship will be particularly useful in evaluating the performance
	of existing structures and specified designs with known lateral strength.
	In particular, unlike most past studies, it does not pre-fix the
	ductility level.},

	characterizing it in terms of six best practices and assigning a
	different priority to each of these. That is, the practice with the
	highest priority was primarily applied to the project. The paper

  abstract = {Wide area networks of increasing end-to-end capacity and capability
	are vital for every phase of high energy physicists' work. Our bandwidth
	usage, and the typical capacity of the major national backbones and
	intercontinental links used by our field have progressed by a factor
	of several hundred times over the past decade. With the opening of
	the LHC era in 2009-10 and the prospects for discoveries in the upcoming
	LHC run, the outlook is for a continuation or an acceleration of
	these trends using next generation networks over the next few years.
	Responding to the need to rapidly distribute and access datasets
	of tens to hundreds of terabytes drawn from multi-petabyte data stores,
	high energy physicists working with network engineers and computer
	scientists are learning to use long range networks effectively on
	an increasing scale, and aggregate flows reaching the 100 Gbps range
	have been observed. The progress of the LHC, and the unprecedented
	ability of the experiments to produce results rapidly using worldwide
	distributed data processing and analysis has sparked major, emerging
	changes in the LHC Computing Models, which are moving from the classic
	hierarchical model designed a decade ago to more agile peer-to-peer-like
	models that make more effective use of the resources at Tier2 and
	Tier3 sites located throughout the world. A new requirements working
	group has gauged the needs of Tier2 centers, and charged the LHCOPN
	group that runs the network interconnecting the LHC Tierls with designing
	a new architecture interconnecting the Tier2s. As seen from the perspective
	of ICFA's Standing Committee on Inter-regional Connectivity (SCIC),
	the Digital Divide that separates physicists in several regions of
	the developing world from those in the developed world remains acute,
	although many countries have made major advances through the rapid
	installation of modern network infrastructures. A case in point is
	Africa, where a new round of undersea cables promises to transform

	Animal factors examined were parity and BCS, whereas dietary factors

	DMI decreased 32% during the final 3 wk of gestation, and 89% of

	19.7, and 24.2% of explained variation in DMI, respectively, and
	R2 of this linear multivariable model was 0.18. Cows had higher DMI
	than heifers. DMI decreased linearly as BCS, RUP, and NDF increased,
	decreased quadratically as EE increased, and increased quadratically
	as RDP increased. Moreover, the magnitude of DMI depression as animals
	approached parturition was affected by characteristics of animals
	and dietary nutrient composition. There were significant parity x
	EE, BCS x NDF, RUP x NDF, RDP x NDF, NDF x EE, and RUP x EE interactions

	and safety-critical systems, challenge the testing process in unexpected
	manners. To our knowledge, there are very few studies focusing on
	these aspects in relation to testing as perceived by different contributors
	in the software development process. This paper qualitatively and
	quantitatively analyses data from an industrial questionnaire survey,
	with a focus on current practices and preferences on contemporary
	aspects of software testing. Specifically, the analysis focuses on
	perceptions of the software testing process in different categories
	of respondents. Categorization of respondents is based on safety-criticality,
	agility, distribution of development, and application domain. While
	confirming some of the commonly acknowledged facts, our findings
	also reveal notable discrepancies between preferred and actual testing
	practices. We believe continued research efforts are essential to
	provide guidelines in the adaptation of the testing process to take
	care of these discrepancies, thus improving the quality and efficiency

	should be included in the next release and to make an appropriate
	time plan of the development project. Compared to the extensive research
	done on requirement selection, very little research has been performed
	on time scheduling. In this paper, we introduce two integer linear
	programming models that integrate time scheduling into software release
	planning. Given the resource and precedence constraints, our first
	model provides a schedule for developing the requirements such that
	the project duration is minimized. Our second model combines requirement
	selection and scheduling, so that it not only maximizes revenues
	but also simultaneously calculates an on-time-delivery project schedule.
	Since requirement dependencies are essential for scheduling the development
	process, we present a more detailed analysis of these dependencies.
	Furthermore, we present two mechanisms that facilitate dynamic adaptation
	for over-estimation or under-estimation of revenues or processing
	time, one of which includes the Scrum methodology. Finally, several
	simulations based on real-life data are performed. The results of
	these simulations indicate that requirement dependency can significantly
	influence the requirement selection and the corresponding project
	plan. Moreover, the model for combined requirement selection and
	scheduling outperforms the sequential selection and scheduling approach
	in terms of efficiency and on-time delivery. © 2010 The Author(s).},

  abstract = {In today's fast paced military operational environment, vast amounts
	of information must be sorted out and fused not only to allow commanders
	to make situation assessments, but also to support the generation
	of hypotheses about enemy force disposition and enemy intent. Current
	information fusion technology has the following two limitations.
	First, current approaches do not consider the battlefield context
	as a first class entity. In contrast, we consider situational context
	in terms of terrain analysis and inference. Second, there are no
	integrated and implemented models of the high-level fusion process.
	This paper describes the HiLIFE (High-Level Information Fusion Environment)
	computational framework for seamless integration of high levels of
	fusion (levels 2, 3 and 4). The crucial components of HiLIFE that
	we present in this paper are: (1) multi-sensor fusion algorithms
	and their performance results that operate in heterogeneous sensor
	networks to determine not only single targets but also force aggregates,
	(2) computational approaches for terrain-based analysis and inference
	that automatically combine low-level terrain features (such as forested
	areas, rivers, etc.) and additional information, such as weather,
	and transforms them into high-level militarily relevant abstractions,
	such as NO-GO, SLOW-GO areas, avenues of approach, and engagement
	areas, (3) a model for inferring adversary intent by mapping sensor
	readings of opponent forces to possible opponent goals and actions,
	and (4) sensor management for positioning intelligence collection
	assets for further data acquisition. The HiLIFE framework closes
	the loop on information fusion by specifying how the different components
	can computationally work together in a coherent system. Furthermore,
	the framework is inspired by a military process, the Intelligence
	Preparation of the Battlefield, that grounds the framework in practice.
	HiLIFE is integrated with a distributed military simulation system,
	OTBSAF, and the RETSINA multi-agent infrastructure to provide agile
	and sophisticated reasoning. In addition, the paper presents validation
	results of the automated terrain analysis that were obtained through
	experiments using military intelligence Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).

  abstract = {Since the software radio concept was introduced, much progress has
	been made in the past few years in making it a reality. Many software-radio-based
	systems have been designed through the development efforts of both
	commercial and noncommercial organizations. While the term software
	radio has meant many things, the ultimate goal in software radio
	has been the realization of an agile radio that can transmit and
	receive signals at any carrier frequency using any protocol, all
	of which can be reprogrammed virtually instantaneously. Such a system
	places great demands on the limits of data converter and processor
	technologies since it requires real-time disposition of gigasamples
	of data produced by direct conversion of wireless signals into digital
	data. From a processing standpoint, the challenge in software radio
	is to exploit the three basic processor types - fixed architecture
	processors, FPGAs, and programmable DSPs/ RISCs/CISCs - in such a
	way as to optimize the three-way trade-offs between speed, power
	dissipation, and programmability. With respect to the latter characteristic,
	the issues of high-level language interfaces, portability, and reprogramming
	speed must be considered. This article describes the architecture
	and operation of a PC-based software radio receiver. The development
	environment is a real-time PC-based platform that allows testing
	to be done in a simple manner using the main software functionality
	of a PC. The front-end of the receiver implemented in hardware represents
	a novel wideband design (bandwidth of up to 100 MHz centered at a
	carrier frequency of up to 2 GHz) that functionally converts wireless
	signals directly into a gigasample digital data stream in the receiver
	(and vice versa in the transmitter). This direct conversion approach
	shows the greatest promise in realizing the main goal of software
	radio.},

	and collaborative communication network. This GIG is viewed as the
	single most important contributor to combat power and protection
	[1]. The GIG can be characterized as a globally interconnected, end-toend
	set of disparate information and processing capabilities available
	on-demand to warfighters, policymakers and support personnel. Management
	of the GIG resources and operation will be, of necessity, intrinsic
	to the architecture and transparent to the user. The development
	an architecture that is secure against malicious exploitation, data
	or service denial and data corruption is a principal focus. Introduction
	of mobile, adhoc network elements having intermittent network connectivity
	and limited life exacerbates this problem. In this paper we explore
	the GIG and present an innovative application of Autonomic Agent
	technology currently in development that has the potential to automate
	many of the obligatory network management tasks. Additionally, we
	introduce a GIG Simulation Testbed that, utilizing Discrete Event
	System Specification (DEVS), is proving useful in simulating GIG
	operation at the node level for the analysis of agent-based detection
	and neutralization of network cyber attacks by malicious parties
	and programs.},

  note = {cited By (since 1996) 0},
  abstract = {Advanced marine modeling and design systems and tools can provide
	significant returns on investment in the form of more standardized
	deliverables, more rules-based design automation, and more customization
	to enable process innovation. These benefits can be achieved through
	the adoption of a technology, such as SmartMarine 3D, which offers
	a rule-driven solution for streamlining the design process. Working
	with an organization's in-house experts, familiar with the design
	and production practices, an implementation plan can be created to
	automate the most common modeling practices. Depending on the background
	of the in-house domain experts and/or the technology, design experts
	may require some amount of time and training using the new technology
	before sufficient knowledge and skills can be achieved - ultimately
	slipping the start of the customization efforts, prolonging the implementation
	timeframe, and delaying the point where the return on investment
	begins to generate savings. Since the creation of a rule driven solution
	involves some sort of ``programming{''} , it is logical to look to
	the software development community for techniques and methods to
	do this work in an effective and efficient manner. Utilizing standard
	Agile programming methodologies, teams are created with individuals
	that fulfill roles such as subject matter expert, developer, product
	owner, documentation specialist, and tester. These knowledge resources
	are collocated and work on prioritized backlog items with known business
	values for fixed length cycles with identified Conditions of Satisfaction.
	In this paper, we will discuss the pros and cons of this approach
	and summarize the experience of ``lessons learned{''} through an
	actual implementation project, which includes development of customized

  note = {cited By (since 1996) 0},
  abstract = {Code reviews are an integral part of the development of a dependable
	system such as for airport operations. It is commonly accepted that
	code reviews are an effective quality assurance technique even if
	a rigorous application is also a high cost factor. For large software
	systems a formal method may be inapplicable throughout the whole
	codebase. In this study an airport operational database (AODB) is
	developed with the application of a more lightweight approach to
	code reviews. A continuous, distributed and change-based process
	is applied by the development team and evaluated in comparison to
	team walkthroughs (IEEE-1028) as a baseline method. The application
	showed to be highly useful, equally effective as the baseline, but
	more efficient especially for the preparation, execution and rework
	effort. The results show that continuous code reviews also support
	the understanding of the codebase and the concept of collective ownership.
	Such processes may not completely substitute a more formal and effortful
	technique. Especially for reviewing critical design aspects or complex
	items a traditional approach is still more appropriate. The main
	outcome is that such lightweight code reviews may be used together
	with more formal approaches to ensure a high coverage and that the

  abstract = {One of the most important phases regarding Software Project Management
	is planning. On this phase, efforts and resources estimation must
	be taken into account considering human, materials, infrastructure,
	time, and budget. Generally, it depends on technical, environmental,
	human and political factors. It also can affect software final cost
	and development effort. The estimation tackled on this work was based
	on Use Case Points (UCP) effort estimation technique, introduced
	by Gustav Karner in 1993. This paper considered both the best and
	the worst scenarios for developing a software product. It helped
	to verify and reveal which are the activities that may cause project
	lateness. The major contribution of this work was to provide acceptable
	software estimation for avionics system development and case study
	integration for an Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Project. The UCP
	effort estimation was applied to just one UAS named Preliminary Testing
	Monitoring Station (PTMS). That system was considered as a key part
	of the UAS Project. The strategy to get accurate estimate was the
	utilization of a well-defined software process, where documentation
	was continuously improved. This work has adopted Rational Unified
	Process (RUP), Unified Modeling Language (UML), and Object-Orientation
	(OO). RUP has a specific artifact for use case models and the estimation
	was accomplished by taking information from this artifact. Another
	contribution of this work was the development of a software tool
	based upon the UCP technique. At the end, this paper reports significant
	estimate results to help project managers taking important decisions
	throughout the project development life-cycle. © 2008 IEEE.},

	practice on software engineering. There are numerous successful and
	classic cases for applying agile methods. However, software processes
	must adapt to the characteristics of projects, people and organizations.
	Since each software project is unique, we can hardly define a series
	of universal and repeatable processes for all agile projects. A pattern
	is a general solution to a common problem or issue, one from which
	a specific solution may be derived. This paper introduces concept
	of pattern into software process and organizes experience proved
	to be effective in agile methods as a group of patterns. Based on
	this group of process patterns, we propose a process pattern language
	PPL for agile methods. Any agile project can find a series of process
	patterns from PPL according to its characteristics, and generate
	an appropriate process by following instructions from these patterns.
	We also give an example of applying this pattern language to generate

	in depth into the actual behavior of a mature Scrum team in industry.
	Using interviews and participant observation, we collected qualitative
	data from five team members in several interactions. We extract the
	behavior of the team and of the software company in terms of the
	determinants of self-managing team effectiveness defined in a theoretical
	model from the literature. We found evidence that 17 out of 24 determinants
	of this model exist in the studied context. We concluded that certain

	significant benefit to many kinds of conglomerates in resource sharing.
	With central management of centre console, Service Composition Optimal
	Selection (SCOS) and Optimal Allocation of Computing Resources (OACR)
	are two critical steps for implementing high flexible and agile service
	provision and resource sharing among sub-enterprises and partner-enterprises
	under the key technologies of virtualization. However, two steps
	decision-making are inefficient and cumbersome. To overcome this
	deficiency, the idea of combining SCOS and OACR into one-time decision

	of Cloud Services and Computing Resources (DS-CSCR). The mutual relations
	between the upper layer cloud services and the underlying infrastructures
	and their properties in the private cloud of conglomerate are deeply
	analyzed. For addressing large-scale DS-CSCR problem, a new Ranking
	Chaos Optimization (RCO) is proposed. With the consideration of large-scale
	irregular solution spaces, new adaptive chaos operator is designed
	to traverse wider spaces within a short time. Besides, dynamic heuristic
	and ranking selection are introduced to control the chaos evolution
	in the proposed algorithm. Theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate
	that the new DS-CSCR outperforms the traditional two-level decision
	making with the improvements in both cloud service composition and
	computing resource allocation. In addition, RCO can remarkably give
	much prominent solutions with low time-consuming and high stability
	than a few typical intelligent algorithms for solving DS-CSCR in

	infrastructures can then be quickly combined and shared with high

	the architecture of event processing in enterprise information systems
	is proposed; event meta model is put forth, and the rules are defined.

	dimensions - including personnel, user requirements, regulation,
	and technology architectures. The rapidity, extent, and inevitability
	of this environmental change are credited as the major catalysts
	for a move away from traditional, plan-driven ISD methods (i.e. the
	Waterfall method) toward the agile method paradigm. Agile methods
	are known for several main operational strategies, including iterative
	development, significant user involvement and frequent releases.
	Agile method adoption, however, does come with risks. These risks
	must be carefully identified and managed within any potential agile-adopter.
	This is particularly so within a small adopting organization that
	is less able to absorb the impact of any significant level of failed
	ISD experimentation. This study describes the identification and
	analysis of the major risk in the adoption of agile methods by a
	Small-to-Medium-Enterprise (SME) software developer. The study was
	completed over a twelve month period during which the SME moved from
	Waterfall ISD to agile ISD. Research data has been obtained via an
	exploratory case study utilizing the risk-identifying Agility/Discipline
	Assessment (A/DA). The A/DA data collection involved interviews and
	observations across three different SME sources: project managers,
	project team members, and customers. The case study factor analysis
	synthesised the experiences of these stake holders to produce a comprehensive
	understanding of the strategic management challenges. The contribution
	from this study is that the SME agile method adoption faced one very
	major risk - a risk that could not be effectively controlled. The
	risk is posed by the need for the SME and the customer to formalize
	the customer relationship via the negotiation of an appropriate contract.
	It proves very difficult to negotiate such a contract whilst not
	constraining the full potential of agile ISD.},

	the introduction XP practices, helping both inexperienced teams and

  abstract = {Due to the complexity and size of embedded software together with
	strong demands on time-to-market and quality, testing is a crucial
	point that should be addressed during software development. Traditionally,
	testing is carried out during the last phases of the software development
	life cycle. As a consequence, testing activities are often subject
	to high time pressure, which either results in delayed market introduction
	or low product quality. The validation of functional and real-time
	requirements of embedded systems is a difficult task. It usually
	needs the electronic control unit and the controlled hardware components.
	But very often the hardware components are not available for testing
	the control software at the beginning of the development. In this
	paper, we paper presents how test cases can be designed from use
	cases and how embedded control software can be validated without
	hardware components by simulating the test cases in early development
	phases using the AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming). For achieving
	an aspect oriented testable format, extended UML sequence diagrams
	are applied to formalize sequences of events, which have been specified
	in the use case scenarios. Provided that black box aspect oriented
	is used for developing embedded component applications, the monitoring
	of the dynamic behavior inside the components is not possible during
	simulation. But the simulated dynamic behavior is observable on the
	connections between the software components. In such a way monitored
	and recorded time stamp events are finally compared offline against
	the expected sequences of events specified in the test cases. The
	offline comparison validates the simulated behavior by demonstrating
	the fulfillment of user requirements and by detecting errors in case
	of contradictions during modeling. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin

	the use of assertions or contracts over that of test cases. Yet,
	writing self-checks in code has been shown to be difficult and is
	itself prone to errors. A standard technique to specify runtime properties
	is design-by contract(DbC). But how can one test if the contracts

	the goodness of contracts (or assertions in a broader sense). We
	introduce meta-mutations at the source code level to simulate common
	programmer errors that the self-checks are supposed to detect. We
	then use random mutation testing to determine a lower and upper bound
	on the detectable mutations and compare these bounds with the number
	of mutants detected by the contracts. Contracts are considered ldquogoodrdquo
	if they detect a certain percentage of the detectable mutations.We
	have evaluated our tools on Java classes with contracts specified

	program both to identify the problems and assess the impact of solutions
	is key to satisfying this need. Avaya has had such a program in place
	for about seven years. Every year we produce an annual report known
	as the State of Software in Avaya that describes software development
	trends throughout the company and that contains prioritized recommendations
	for improving Avaya's software development capabilities. We start
	by identifying the goals of the enterprise and use the goal-question-metric
	approach to identify the measures to compute. The result is insight
	into the enterprise's problems in software development, recommendations
	for improving the development process, and problems that require
	research to solve. We will illustrate the process with examples from
	the Software Technology Research Department in Avaya Labs whose purpose
	is to improve the state of software development and know it. ``Know
	it{''} means that improvement should be subjectively evident and
	objectively quantifiable. ``Know it{''} also means that one must
	be skilled at identifying the data sources, performing the appropriate
	analyses to answer the questions of interest, and validating that
	the data are accurate and appropriate for the purpose. Examples will
	include how and why we developed a measure of software quality that
	appeals to customers, how and why we are studying the effectiveness
	of distributed software development, and how and why we are helping
	development organizations to adopt iterative development methods.
	We will also discuss how we keep the company and the department apprised
	of the current strengths and weaknesses of software development in
	Avaya through the publication of the annual Stateof Software in Avaya

	approaches was very much industry-led at the outset, and while agile
	method research is growing, the vast majority of these studies are
	descriptive and often lack a strong theoretical and conceptual base.
	Insights from innovation adoption research can provide a new perspective
	on analysing agile method use. This paper is based on an exploratory
	study of the application of the innovation assimilation stages to
	understand the use of agile practices, focusing in particular on
	the later stages of assimilation, namely acceptance, routinisation
	and infusion. Four case studies were conducted, and based on the
	case study findings, the concepts of acceptance, routinisation and
	infusion were adapted and applied to agile software development.
	These adapted concepts were used to glean interesting insights into
	agile practice use. For example, it was shown that the period of
	use of agile practices does not have a proportional effect on their
	assimilation depths. We also reflected on the sequential assumption
	underlying the assimilation stages, showing that adopting teams do
	not always move through the assimilation stages in a linear manner.

	It is based upon the proven and reliable relational database approach,
	and provides choice from a range of well-supported Relational Database
	Management System (RDBMS) packages. Major compiler and systems support
	players continue to offer increased features (e.g. object data-type
	definition and storage support in Microsoft's ADO.Net in Windows
	2005), which are supportive of the O-R approach and contribute to
	a healthy O-R future. With the appropriate design techniques and
	persistence software support, the O-R approach represents the fastest,
	most reliable way to develop efficient, scalable, maintainable applications
	software. An added bonus is that the skill set of developers transferring
	from Relational-Procedural to Object Oriented (OO) application development
	is well suited to the O-R approach. With appropriate persistence
	support software, business object mapping and persistence can be
	automated, freeing application developers from the time-consuming
	tasks of mapping objects to database tables and the (re)writing of
	database access code. The O-R approach can be a SQL-free experience,
	allowing developers to concentrate on CRUD (Create, Read, Update
	and Delete) access and processing of individual or groups of business
	objects without having to worry about the underpinning relational
	database framework being used to persist business object data. The
	object-oriented application development becomes transformed into
	a simple 3-step process: 1. Develop an Implementation Object Class
	Model, 2. Generate the Business Objects and Object Database for object
	persistence, and 3. Code and test the application based upon the
	Business Objects. The key to success for this development process
	lies in the first step, 'develop an Implementation Object Class Model',
	because the way in which object class associations are implemented
	can significantly affect the performance of applications that depend
	upon them. Conversely, any time and effort spent producing a good
	business class design can be completely negated in terms of object
	access performance due to poor association implementation. The UML
	design process, which is pivotal to any OO development, places considerable
	emphasis upon the identification and differentiation of associations
	between objects. One significant weakness of the UML design process
	is the provision of too little support for implementation planning
	too late in the development process. This article tackles this problem
	by introducing some simple high-level implementation semantics for
	association implementation using the UML Object Class diagram. It
	discusses data structures and logic support to underpin various alternatives
	using an OR approach, and shows how implementation planning for associations
	can fit into the application development cycle to form the basis
	of an agile, practical and targeted OO application development methodology.},

  note = {cited By (since 1996) 3},
  abstract = {Cloud computing is all the rage these days; its confluence with mobile
	computing would bring an even more pervasive influence. Clouds per
	se are elastic computing infrastructure where mobile applications
	can offload or draw tasks in an on-demand push-pull manner. Lightweight
	and portable task migration support enabling better resource utilization
	and data access locality is the key for success of mobile cloud computing.
	Existing task migration mechanisms are however too coarse-grained
	and costly, offsetting the benefits from migration and hampering
	flexible task partitioning among the mobile and cloud resources.
	We propose a new computation migration technique called stack-on-demand
	(SOD) that exports partial execution states of a stack machine to
	achieve agile mobility, easing into small-capacity devices and flexible
	distributed execution in a multi-domain workflow style. Our design
	also couples SOD with a novel object faulting technique for efficient
	access to remote objects. We implement the SOD concept into a middleware
	system for transparent execution migration of Java programs. It is
	shown that SOD migration cost is pretty low, comparing to several
	existing migration mechanisms. We also conduct experiments with an
	iPhone handset to demonstrate the elasticity of SOD by which server-side
	heavyweight processes can run adaptively on the cell phone. © 2010

	development. An illustrative example is presented. Findings - The
	results provide a robust model that will aid decision makers and

	a conceptual model with an illustrative validating example. A practical
	application and reapplication of the model are required to further
	validate the model. ANP can require significant managerial input
	for its application, potentially causing fatigue for decision makers.
	Practical implications - Practical implications include a partner

  abstract = {The global market is evermore volatile and turbulent; it requires
	rapid responses to the emerging customers needs, also to unpredictable
	ones. Companies are forced towards a continuous research and innovation
	in terms of flexible technologies and processes in order to provide
	a high level of market adaptability. In this context, agile approaches,
	intended as a set of strategies to face the market variability, have
	to be investigated. They have to interest all processes related to
	the product development phase. This paper is focused on how to implement
	an efficient agile strategy in product design. The proposed approach
	is based on product modularity and on the integration of computer-aided
	design (CAD)-based tools to support feasibility analysis on virtual
	prototypes. It allows the concurrent management of possible changes
	in both product and process platforms by adopting virtual prototypes
	for performing simulations. The implemented platforms and the connected
	virtual prototype are structured according to modularity principles.
	The virtual prototype is defined as a collection of geometrical,
	functional, structural, manufacturing, environmental information,
	contained in the modules of the product and process platforms. An
	industrial example, belonging to the wellness production field (such
	as bathtubs and shower stalls), is described to validate the agile
	approach. It has been applied to solve a particularly meaningful
	problem: how to improve the bathtubs production process by reducing
	manufacturing and assembly costs while improving product customisability,
	eco-sustainability and quality. Once analysed, the context and the
	design constraints, in terms of cost, of environmental performance
	and, mainly, of aesthetic product features customisation, a new manufacturing
	process has been introduced based on the injection moulding technology

  abstract = {Agile Methods are designed for customization, they offer an organization

	based on their culture and values. While that flexibility is consistent
	with the agile philosophy, it can lead to the adoption of principles
	and practices that can be sub-optimal relative to the desired objectives.
	We question then, how can one determine if adopted practices are
	``in sync{''} with the identified principles, and to what extent
	those principles support organizational objectives? In this research,
	we focus on assessing the ``goodness{''} of an agile method adopted
	by an organization based on (1) its adequacy, (2) the capability
	of the organization to provide the supporting environment to successfully
	implement the method, and (3) the method's effectiveness. To guide
	our assessment, we propose the Objectives, Principles and Practices
	(OPP) framework. The design of the OPP framework revolves around
	the identification of the agile objectives, principles that support
	the achievement of those objectives, and practices that reflect the
	``spirit{''} of those principles. Well-defined linkages between the
	objectives and principles, and between the principles and practices
	are also established to support the assessment process. We assess
	the adequacy of an agile method by traversing the linkages in a top-down
	fashion. That is, given the set of objectives espoused by the agile
	method, we follow the linkages downward to ensure that the appropriate
	principles are enunciated, and that the proper practices are expressed.
	We assess the capability of an organization to implement its adopted
	method and the effectiveness of that implementation by using both
	a top-down and bottom-up traversal of the linkages. The bottom-up
	assessment, however, is predicated on the identification of people,
	process, project and product properties associated with each practice
	that attest to the presence and implementation of that practice.
	We refer to each prac- - tice, property pair as an indicator. By
	following the linkages upward from the indicators, we can infer the
	use of proper principles and the achievement of desired objectives.},

	how XP and Serum can complement each other to provide a comprehensive
	agile development method, with XP providing support for technical
	aspects and Serum providing support for project planning and tracking.
	The manner in which XP and Serum have been customized to suit the
	needs of the development environment at Intel Shannon is described,
	as are the lessons learned. The XP practices that were applied did
	lead to significant benefits, with pair-programming leading to reductions
	in code defect density, of a factor of seven, and one project actually
	achieving zero defect density However, some observed limitations
	of pair-programming are described. Intel Shannon also found that
	not all XP practices were applicable in their context. Thus. the
	study suggests that, contrary to suggestions that XP is not divisible
	or individually selectable, a la carte selection and tailoring of
	XP practices can work very well. In the case of Serum, some local
	customization has led to a very committed adoption by developers
	themselves, in contrast to many development methods whose use is
	decreed mandatory by management. The success of Scrum is significant.

	processes. However, after analyzing many of the existing traceability
	approaches it can be concluded that they strongly depend on traditional
	development process characteristics. Within this paper it is justified
	that this is a drawback to support adequately agile processes. As
	it is discussed, some concepts do not have the same semantics for
	traditional and agile methodologies. This paper proposes three features
	that traceability models should support to be less dependent on a
	specific development process: (1) user-definable traceability links,
	(2) roles, and (3) linkage rules. To present how these features can
	be applied, an emerging traceability metamodel (TmM) will be used
	within this paper. Tm Msupports the definition of traceability methodologies
	adapted to the needs of each project. As it is shown, after introducing
	these three features into traceability models, two main advantages
	are obtained: 1) the support they can provide to agile process stakeholders
	is significantly more extensive, and 2) it will be possible to achieve
	a higher degree of automation. In this sense it will be feasible
	to have a methodical trace acquisition and maintenance process adapted

	for a two-fold impact: first, the ability to detect trends that lead

	in product quality may suffer from the lack of testing. This consequence
	is serious enough to warrant consideration, since overall quality

	significant because other industry studies have concluded that many

	Our objective is thus to provide a better understanding of the nature
	of self-managing agile teams, and the teamwork challenges that arise
	when introducing such teams. Method: We conducted extensive fieldwork
	for 9 months in a software development company that introduced Scrum.
	We focused on the human sensemaking, on how mechanisms of teamwork
	were understood by the people involved. Results: We describe a project
	through Dickinson and McIntyre's teamwork model, focusing on the
	interrelations between essential teamwork components. Problems with
	team orientation, team leadership and coordination in addition to
	highly specialized skills and corresponding division of work were
	important barriers for achieving team effectiveness. Conclusion:
	Transitioning from individual work to self-managing teams requires
	a reorientation not only by developers but also by management. This
	transition takes time and resources, but should not be neglected.
	In addition to Dickinson and McIntyre's teamwork components, we found
	trust and shared mental models to be of fundamental importance. ©

  note = {cited By (since 1996) 0},
  abstract = {Methodology adoption issues in the agile world are faced with challenges
	such as the growing trend towards the use of a group of relevant
	cross-methodology practices from the agile family as opposed to the
	adoption of individual methodologies. While this may see agile processes
	precipitating towards more mature software engineering processes,
	the challenge is that some of the specific agile methodologies may
	become extinct over time. This research therefore contributes a key
	addition to knowledge by developing a thinking tool that will guide
	system developers to informatively select agile practices from the
	entire agile methodologies family that are relevant to the project
	at hand. This paper proposes a novel modeling technique for tailoring
	methodologies to a particular environment using the family of methodologies
	approach. The Agile Methodologies Generic (AMG) model considers agile
	methodologies as a group of methodologies with common parameters
	that can be used to model the entire group. Based on this model,
	methodology parameters can be identified that are common among the
	different agile methodologies making it possible to create a set
	of relevant agile practices that can be used in an organization.
	The original concepts of the model are based on two foundations:
	1) the philosophy of Jim Highsmith's Adaptive Software Development
	(ASD) methodology. ASD focuses on the speculate, collaborate and
	learn cycle iteratively which is fundamental to agile development,
	and 2) the concept of organizational maturity levels which says that
	mature organizations families of repeatable and automated processes.
	It is from such a perspective that AMG was born. AMG considers agile
	methodologies at an abstract level where the four values of the Agile
	Manifesto are assumed to collectively constitute basic philosophy
	of all agile methodologies. The phases of AMG (mechanistic, organic,
	and synergistic adaptation) are therefore analyzed in light of the
	values of the project at hand. The benefits of such a technology
	is the provision of a thinking tool that assists software development
	teams to effectively tailor agile methodologies to their project
	environments. The tool has been applied by two software development
	organisations and the results are being analysed. © Springer-Verlag

  pages = {82-92},
  note = {cited By (since 1996) 1},
  abstract = {High energy consumption has become a critical problem for supercomputer
	systems. GPU clusters are becoming an increasingly popular architecture
	for building supercomputers because of its great improvement in performance.
	In this paper, we first formulate the tasks mapping problem as a
	minimal energy consumption problem with deadline constraint. Its
	optimizing object is very different from the traditional mapping
	problem which often aims at minimizing makespan or minimizing response
	time. Then a Waterfall Energy Consumption Model, which abstracts
	the energy consumption of one GPU cluster system into several levels
	from high to low, is proposed to achieve an energy efficient tasks
	mapping for large scale GPU clusters. Based on our Waterfall Model,
	a new task mapping algorithm is developed which tries to apply different
	energy saving strategies to keep the system remaining at lower energy
	levels. Our mapping algorithm adopts the Dynamic Voltage Scaling,
	Dynamic Resource Scaling and β-migration for GPU sub-task to significantly
	reduce the energy consumption and achieve a better load balance for
	GPU clusters. A task generator based on the real task traces is developed
	and the simulation results show that our mapping algorithm based
	on the Waterfall Model can reduce nearly 50% energy consumption compared
	with traditional approaches which can only run at a high energy level.
	Not only the task deadline can be satisfied, but also the task execution
	time of our mapping algorithm can be reduced. © 2011 IEEE.},

	between chromosomes 8 and 9 (WAT8/9) specific to Sumatran agile gibbons.
	Furthermore, population surveys suggested that the form with the
	WAT8/9 seems to be incompatible with an ancestral form, suggesting
	that the former might have extinguished the latter from Sumatran
	populations by competition. In any case, this translocation is a
	useful chromosomal marker for identifying Sumatran agile gibbons.
	Population genetic analyses with DNA showed that the molecular genetic
	distance between Sumatran and Bornean agile gibbons is the smallest,
	although the chromosomal difference is the largest. Thus, it is postulated
	that WAT8/9 occurred and fixed in a small population of Sumatra after
	migration and geographical isolation at the last glacial period,
	and afterwards dispersed rapidly to other populations in Sumatra
	as a result of the bottleneck effect and a chromosomal isolating

  note = {cited By (since 1996) 0},
  abstract = {For too long software has been produced using processes that result
	in a product that is completed late, over-budget, and below the quality
	expectations of end users. Over the last 25 years a great many incremental,
	evolutionary, and iterative software development process models have
	been introduced with the intention of improving software development;
	yet a recent study by the Standish Group reported that fewer than
	28% of software projects are completed on schedule within budget
	and with most of the originally required features. We believe that
	getting the requirements right is the key to building successful
	and reliable software products. In the requirements process the product
	features are defined, the users are identified, and the user interactions
	with the system are designed. In addition, usage profiles are developed
	and estimates of the anticipated software reliability based on those
	profiles and on formal models of the system are obtained. Thus, reliability
	becomes an integral part of the requirement development process rather
	than an after thought of testing at the end of the development process.

	framework for large scale image processing and analysis over heterogeneous
	computing resources, such as those available in clouds, grids, computer
	clusters or throughout scattered computer resources (desktops, labs)
	in an opportunistic manner. Through BIGS, eScience for image processing
	and analysis is conceived to exploit coarse grained parallelism based
	on data partitioning and parameter sweeps, avoiding the need of inter-process
	communication and, therefore, enabling loosely coupled computing
	nodes (BIGS workers). It adopts an uncommitted resource allocation
	model where (1) experimenters define their image processing pipelines
	in a simple configuration file, (2) a schedule of jobs is generated
	and (3) workers, as they become available, take over pending jobs
	as long as their dependency on other jobs is fulfilled. BIGS workers
	act autonomously, querying the job schedule to determine which one
	to take over. This removes the need for a central scheduling node,
	requiring only access by all workers to a shared information source.
	Furthermore, BIGS workers are encapsulated within different technologies
	to enable their agile deployment over the available computing resources.
	Currently they can be launched through the Amazon EC2 service over
	their cloud resources, through Java Web Start from any desktop computer
	and through regular scripting or SSH commands. This suits well different
	kinds of research environments, both when accessing dedicated computing
	clusters or clouds with committed computing capacity or when using
	opportunistic computing resources whose access is seldom or cannot
	be provisioned in advance. We also adopt a NoSQL storage model to
	ensure the scalability of the shared information sources required
	by all workers, including within BIGS support for HBase and Amazon's
	DynamoDB service. Overall, BIGS now enables researchers to run large
	scale image processing pipelines in an easy, affordable and unplanned
	manner with the capability to take over computing resources as they
	become available at run time. This is shown in this paper by using
	BIGS in different experimental setups in the Amazon cloud and in
	an opportunistic manner, demonstrating its configurability, adaptability
	and scalability capabilities.},

  abstract = {Background: An incremental, loosely planned development approach is
	often used in bioinformatic studies when dealing with custom data
	analysis in a rapidly changing environment. Unfortunately, the lack
	of a rigorous software structuring can undermine the maintainability,
	communicability and replicability of the process. To ameliorate this
	problem we propose the Leaf system, the aim of which is to seamlessly
	introduce the pipeline formality on top of a dynamical development
	process with minimum overhead for the programmer, thus providing
	a simple layer of software structuring.Results: Leaf includes a formal
	language for the definition of pipelines with code that can be transparently
	inserted into the user's Python code. Its syntax is designed to visually
	highlight dependencies in the pipeline structure it defines. While
	encouraging the developer to think in terms of bioinformatic pipelines,
	Leaf supports a number of automated features including data and session
	persistence, consistency checks between steps of the analysis, processing
	optimization and publication of the analytic protocol in the form
	of a hypertext.Conclusions: Leaf offers a powerful balance between
	plan-driven and change-driven development environments in the design,
	management and communication of bioinformatic pipelines. Its unique
	features make it a valuable alternative to other related tools. ©

	cannot succeed unless management is committed to implementing it.
	Fortunately, the move to SPI can be a two-way street, initiated as
	easily from the bottom up as from the top down. Taking this bottom-up
	approach, I present some tricks that practitioners down in the trenches
	can use to win upper management's approval of and support for SPI.
	My first opportunity to introduce bottom-up process changes occurred
	on a project in which my job was basically coding and testing. Initially,
	I was assigned to the maintenance coding of the product's previous
	release, which proved to be a real headache. So I had my motives
	for making improvements. According to the waterfall model we were
	using, the project was about halfway through the design phase. A
	lot of lower-level design and unit and integration testing remained.
	I was assigned one part of the system, and the remaining design and
	unit testing tasks were given to the 15 people we had allocated to
	us for the next five months. Given the amount of work that lay before
	us, these resources were not nearly enough. One subproject leader
	realized that our complex and lengthy design task would prove a huge

	has specific requirements for information system functionality because
	of relative big amount of patients. The information system used currently
	by (EMSCP) has as primary purpose to prepare reports about health
	care provided for Insurance companies and has become insufficient
	in other above mentioned areas. Because no other relevant information
	system vendor was found on local market, the decision to develop
	such system ``from scratch{''} was taken. Methods: The analysis objectives
	were the creation of EMSCP object model and functional requirements
	specification that will be implemented in final system. Object model
	was prepared in team cooperation with EMSCP representatives. The
	quantity of information kept by each model's objects was specified.
	The final system is developed using object oriented programming during
	analysis results implementation into source code. This approach makes
	system modular and extensible. Basic principles of Extreme programming
	are used in project. Results: After application of standards for
	Management of information to object oriented analysis results the
	final metaphor of system was fixed. The model supports following
	requirements: Authorization of data access and data change by system
	user is based on Role & Permission model where permissions are grouped
	into roles that are then assigned to system user. This model provides
	possibility to assign different level of access authorization to
	different system users (physician, nurse, insurance report maker,
	system administrator, etc.). Each data change by use is uniquely
	identified (who, when and from which client machine made data changed).
	Audit of changes made by user during session (possibility to reconstruct
	exact user activities). During each change the former data record
	is moved and kept into history (workflow analysis, change of data
	back to specific time in history). Conclusion: Circa 65% of system
	analysis is currently implemented into source code, so it is still
	very soon for evaluation of general system and its contribution to
	EMSCP users. Anyway the experience with project shows that chosen
	methodology makes system dynamic, live and adaptive to change request.},

  abstract = {Background: Antimicrobial resistance has reached globally alarming
	levels and is becoming a major public health threat. Lack of efficacious
	antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems was identified as one
	of the causes of increasing resistance, due to the lag time between
	new resistances and alerts to care providers. Several initiatives
	to track drug resistance evolution have been developed. However,
	no effective real-time and source-independent antimicrobial resistance
	monitoring system is available publicly. Objective: To design and
	implement an architecture that can provide real-time and source-independent
	antimicrobial resistance monitoring to support transnational resistance
	surveillance. In particular, we investigated the use of a Semantic
	Web-based model to foster integration and interoperability of interinstitutional
	and cross-border microbiology laboratory databases. Methods: Following
	the agile software development methodology, we derived the main requirements
	needed for effective antimicrobial resistance monitoring, from which
	we proposed a decentralized monitoring architecture based on the
	Semantic Web stack. The architecture uses an ontology-driven approach
	to promote the integration of a network of sentinel hospitals or
	laboratories. Local databases are wrapped into semantic data repositories
	that automatically expose local computing-formalized laboratory information
	in the Web. A central source mediator, based on local reasoning,
	coordinates the access to the semantic end points. On the user side,
	a user-friendly Web interface provides access and graphical visualization
	to the integrated views. Results: We designed and implemented the
	online Antimicrobial Resistance Trend Monitoring System (ARTEMIS)
	in a pilot network of seven European health care institutions sharing
	70+ million triples of information about drug resistance and consumption.
	Evaluation of the computing performance of the mediator demonstrated
	that, on average, query response time was a few seconds (mean 4.3,
	SD 0.1×10 2 seconds). Clinical pertinence assessment showed that
	resistance trends automatically calculated by ARTEMIS had a strong
	positive correlation with the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance
	Network (EARS-Net) (ρ =.86, P &lt;.001) and the Sentinel Surveillance
	of Antibiotic Resistance in Switzerland (SEARCH) (ρ =.84, P &lt;.001)
	systems. Furthermore, mean resistance rates extracted by ARTEMIS
	were not significantly different from those of either EARS-Net (Δ
	= ±0.130; 95% confidence interval -0 to 0.030; P &lt;.001) or SEARCH
	(δ = ±0.042; 95% confidence interval -0.004 to 0.028; P =.004). Conclusions:
	We introduce a distributed monitoring architecture that can be used

	On the other hand, cloud computing is already a reality that helps

	we explore the possibility of having data in a cloud by using BigTable
	to store the corporate historical data and MapReduce as an agile
	mechanism to deploy cubes in ad-hoc Data Marts. Our main contribution
	is the comparison of three different approaches to retrieve data

	be effectively applied in a domain such as software development that
	is fundamentally different from manufacturing. This study explores
	how Lean principles are implemented in software development companies

	For that, a case study was conducted at Ericsson R&D Finland, which
	successfully adopted Scrum in 2009 and subsequently started a comprehensible
	transition to Lean in 2010. Focus groups were conducted with company
	representatives to help devise a questionnaire supporting the creation
	of a Lean mindset in the company (Team Amplifier). Afterwards, the
	questionnaire was used in 16 teams based in Finland, Hungary and
	China to evaluate the status of the transformation. By using Lean
	thinking, Ericsson R&D Finland has made important improvements to
	the quality of its products, customer satisfaction and transparency
	within the organization. Moreover, build times have been reduced
	over ten times and the number of commits per day has increased roughly
	five times.The study makes two main contributions to research. First,
	the main factors that have enabled Ericsson R&D’s achievements are
	analysed. Elements such as ‘network of product owners’, ‘continuous
	integration’, ‘work in progress limits’ and ‘communities of practice’
	have been identified as being of fundamental importance. Second,
	three categories of challenges in using Lean Software Development
	were identified: ‘achieving flow’, ‘transparency’ and ‘creating a

  year = {2012},
  note = {cited By (since 1996) 0},
  abstract = {In 2011, an experiment was undertaken at KTH Royal Institute of Technology
	to introduce agile methods for product development into a mechatronics
	capstone course. This paper describes the method used, Scrum, and
	the context of the studied mechatronics capstone course. Mechatronics
	is here defined as ``synergistic integration{''} of electronics,
	mechanical engineering, control and software engineering. Mechatronics
	product development, in this context, therefore deals with the development
	of complex and intelligent products, which implies multi-disciplinary
	work and the use of models etc. from several domains and areas. With
	the integration of Scrum into the mechatronics capstone course, an
	educational favorable alternative is identified, to previously used
	design methodologies such as more traditional stage-gate methods
	as the Waterfall or method or the V-model. This is due to the emphasis
	on early prototyping, quick feedback and incremental development.
	It still might not be the favorable method for use in large scale
	industrial development projects where formal procedures might still
	be preferred, but the pedagogical advantages in mechatronics education
	are valuable. Incremental development and rapid prototyping for example
	gives many opportunities to reflect and improve. The Scrum focus
	on self-organizing teams also provides a platform to practice project
	organization, by empowering students to take responsibility for the
	product development process. Among the results of this study, it
	is shown that it is possible and favorable to integrate Scrum in
	a mechatronics capstone course and that this can enhance student
	preparation for a future career as mechatronics product developers.
	It is also shown that this prepares the students with a larger flexibility
	to handle the increased complexity in mechatronics product development
	and thereby enabling the project teams to deliver results faster,
	more reliable and with higher quality. © 2012 American Society for

	languages. The evolution of life-cycle models from the waterfall
	model through the operational model to the knowledge-based model
	is examined. The tension between efficiency and modifiability in

	should practice to align their business strategic objectives with
	information and communication technology (ICT). Enterprise Architecture
	encompasses a collection of different views and aspects of the enterprise
	which constitute a comprehensive overview. Such an overview cannot
	be well-organized regardless of incorporating a logical structure
	called Enterprise Architecture Framework (EAF). EAF presents a comprehensive
	and transparent map of an organization showing how all organization
	elements (business and IT) work together to achieve defined business
	objectives. It clarifies the way in which these elements support
	the business processes of the organization. Several distinctive EAF
	have been proposed till now, the main challenges any of these EAF
	faced are (1) defining process is heavy, prolonged and tedious (2)
	Keeping EA artifacts up-to-date is an awkward work. These challenges
	make the artifacts of EA useless and unreliable. A number of researchers
	and practitioners try to eliminate these challenges by using Service
	Oriented (SO) paradigm with common and famous EAF like Zachman and
	FEAF. But none of them completely clarify how SO practices with EA
	concepts combination may be realized and what are the important elements
	of it, they just show an abstract mapping between these two concepts
	and state that this combination can be possible. In this article
	we try to present a service oriented EAF (SOEAF) to eliminate aforementioned
	challenges and elaborated this framework in details. CEA Framework
	involves a SO Roadmap that is completely compatible with ITIL and
	a Classification Schema that cover all aspects of organization, these
	aspects categorize according to Purpose, Pattern or Practice, Policy,
	Stakeholder and Resource. We believe that by using the proposed SOEAF
	referred to as CEA Framework, created enterprise architecture is
	flexible and agile enough to define rapidly and sense the environment
	quickly then, adapt and adopt business and information changes appropriately.

	add functionality, make improvements and incorporate new requirements.
	The development team included technical staff as well as stakeholders,
	future users, business analysts and project managers. The architecture
	chosen was based on open source technologies, with Java servlets
	and Java Server Pages for the Web interface. OSPREY currently supports
	32 journals at the two publishers. Users accomplish all regular tasks
	in peer review (submission, selection and invitation of reviewers,
	submission of review, recommendations and decision) through the software.
	Editorial staff verifies submissions, sends correspondence and assigns
	customizable roles and tasks. All tasks are accomplished through
	a Web browser accessing the application on central servers at the
	publisher, with no special software or configuration required for
	any users. Currently, the system integrates with the publishing system
	by generating manuscript metadata in an XML format, although closer
	integration with a workflow management system is planned. Since OSPREY
	implementation, the number of submissions has risen, although marketing
	and higher ranking of the journals are also factors. For the future,

	coordination, and communication in software projects. Objective:
	Our objective was to understand the challenges of shared decision-making
	in agile software development teams. Method: We designed a multiple
	case study consisting of four projects in two software product companies
	that recently adopted Scrum. We collected data in semi-structured
	interviews, through participant observations, and from process artifacts.
	Results: We identified three main challenges to shared decision-making
	in agile software development: alignment of strategic product plans
	with iteration plans, allocation of development resources, and performing
	development and maintenance tasks in teams. Conclusion: Agile software
	development requires alignment of decisions on the strategic, tactical,
	and operational levels in order to overcome these challenges. Agile
	development also requires a transition from specialized skills to
	redundancy of functions and from rational to naturalistic decision-making.
	This takes time; the case companies needed from one to two years
	to change from traditional, hierarchical decision-making to shared
	decision-making in software development projects. © 2012 Elsevier

	(DBS) is currently being trialled in a number of patients with drug
	unresponsive epilepsies. However, the mechanisms by which DBS interferes
	with neuronal activity linked to the disorder are not well understood.
	Furthermore, there is a need to identify optimized values of parameters
	(for example in amplitude/frequency space) of the stimulation protocol
	with which one aims to achieve the desired outcome. In this paper
	we characterise the system response to stimulation, to gain an understanding
	of the role different brain regions play in generating the output
	observed in EEG. We perform a number of experiments in healthy rats,
	where the ventral-lateral thalamic nucleus is stimulated using a
	train of square-waves with different frequency and amplitudes. The
	response to stimulation in the motor cortex is recorded and the drive-response
	relationship over frequency/amplitude space is considered. Subsequently,
	we compare the experimental data with simulations of a mean-field
	model, finding good agreement between the output of the model and
	the experimental data - both in the time and frequency domains -
	when considering a transition to oscillatory activity in the cortex
	as the frequency of stimulation is increased. Overall, our study
	suggests that mean-field models can appropriately characterise the
	stimulus-response relationship of DBS in healthy animals. In this
	way, it constitutes a first step towards the goal of developing a
	closed-loop feedback control protocol for suppressing epileptic activity,

	terms 'tightness of an SDM' and 'tightness of a national culture1.
	With respect to an SDM, this term articulates the idea that the tighter
	an SDM is, the more ordered the software development process and
	environment it inspires will be; with respect to a national culture,
	the term 'tightness' reflects the degree to which a culture accepts
	and adopts ordered, planned and procedural work habits. The model
	then goes on to outline means that can help in the mapping of a given
	SDM, as well as a given national culture, along the following five
	dimensions: Project plan, procedures and standards, responsibility,
	time estimation, and individual need satisfaction. Finally, based
	on these mappings, the fitness of a given SDM and a national culture
	is examined. It is proposed that this fitness can serve as a tool
	for predicting the degree to which a given SDM will be accepted by
	a specific national culture in general, and by a specific team that
	is part of that culture, in particular. The model is illustrated
	using the Israeli hi-tech industry as an example of a national culture

	introduces the new class RUP of upward drawable graphs, which can
	be embedded on a rolling cylinder. We establish strict inclusions

	loops. However, the transition towards continuous deployment involves
	a number of barriers. This paper presents a multiple-case study in

	continuous deployment. Based on interviews at four different software

	scalability, on-demand self service, availability, and reliability

	by using cloud computing services in healthcare it is possible to
	reach large population of people in isolated geographical areas which
	will assist in saving their lives in critical situations. It enables
	the use of latest technologies through its various service delivery
	and deployment models via the internet on pay-per-use billing pattern.
	However, cloud computing has dark side when it comes to security
	and privacy considerations. Critical industries such as healthcare
	and banking are reluctant to trust cloud computing due to the fear
	of losing their sensitive data, as it resides on the cloud with no
	knowledge of data location and lack of transparency of Cloud Service
	Providers (CSPs) mechanisms used to secure their data and applications
	which have created a barrier against adopting this agile computing
	paradigm. This paper addresses cloud computing security concerns
	that must be considered in order to adopt cloud services in information

	This paper develops a framework for the organization of agile software
	development that identifies enablers and inhibitors of agility and
	the emergent capabilities of agile teams. The work is grounded in
	complex adaptive systems (CAS) and draws on three principles of coevolving
	systems: match coevolutionary change rate, maximize self-organizing,
	and synchronize exploitation and exploration. These principles are
	used to study the processes of two software development teams, one
	a team using eXtreme Programming (XP) and the other a team using
	a more traditional, waterfallbased development cycle. From the cases
	a framework for the organization of agile software development is
	developed. Time pacing, self-management with discipline and routinization
	of exploration are among the agile enablers found in the cases studies
	while event pacing, centralized management, and lack of resources
	allocated to exploration are found to be inhibitors to agility. Emergent
	capabilities of agile teams that are identified from the research
	include coevolution of business value, sustainable working with rhythm,
	sharing and team learning, and collective mindfulness. © 2009 INFORMS.},

	ERP systems could achieve efficient business performance by enabling

	will break traditional norms that combine ERP and enterprise 2.0
	in a single enterprise to improve both efficient and flexible operations
	simultaneously. Based on the multiple cases studies, four cases presented

	European Information Technology Observatory estimates, that in year

	Process Improvement tools, like CMM and ISO 9000 were to cure this
	situation, but some people complain that they are too bureaucratic
	and inflexible. As a result new, so-called agile, methodologies appeared.
	One of them is Extreme Programming (XP) - a lightweight, change-oriented
	and customer-oriented approach to software development. Although
	XP proposes many interesting practices, it has some limitations.
	Moreover, it is not clear how to introduce XP to an organization
	certified to ISO 9001:2000. The aim of the paper is to present a
	modified version of XP that would be acceptable from the point of
	view of ISO 9000.},

  abstract = {In many decades, many organizations, especially large consulting companies,
	have been designing, implementing and managing business solutions
	for every industry around the globe. But due to numerous limitations
	in process, tooling and skills, most of those solutions were made
	very specific to individual industry and client needs at its early
	design stage. Therefore, reuse and more importantly, managing the
	ever changing business requirements, become almost impossible. Service-orientation
	and architecture, model-driven business development provides us a
	new and powerful approach to facilitate asset based industry solution
	design and development. To further accelerate this, this tutorial
	will discuss an innovative approach that take advantage of many proven
	best software engineering practices, from object/component based
	technology, meta-data driven architecture types (archetypes) that
	are used to model the common structural and in some cases non-structural
	business entities such as customer, product, payment, etc. In order
	to address the consequences introduced by abstracting those common
	elements out of the specific industry model and be able to enable
	easy and meta-data based transformation, we properly decompose business
	components/services into a multi-layered business architecture. Therefore,
	process/components/services can be decomposed accordingly to facilitate
	the decomposition and abstraction, while maintaining certain level
	of necessary traceability across various artifacts. In the realization
	phase, existing assets/operational systems will be mapped and transformed
	to the required business components and services to best leverage
	those existing valuable industry/client investments. To support such
	a SOA based, model and business driven development process, existing
	tooling, especially the necessary transformation and integration
	capability, needs to be significantly enhanced. This tutorial will
	also present some recommendation based on some recent design a- -
	nd implementation, and they could be used to guide future tooling
	alignment and integration effort across software modeling, implementation
	and solution products. In addition, we will present how to leverage
	existing internal or external assets or product offerings and the
	open industry reference models and standards (such as ACCORD, ebXML,

	Howerver, these advanced techniques pose a real challenge in terms

	A typical example in this domain is the significant performance improvement
	offered by the use of iterative demodulation with turbo decoding

	by at least one iteration in the waterfall region with respect to
	the Butterfly schedule. This gain in number of iterations comes without
	any overhead in terms of area and without any lose is communication
	performance. Howerver, it results in a throughput improvement around

	approach used in developing a complex software project. This further
	demonstrates how to overcome risks and barriers in each development
	phase of such complex inventive software projects. It also provides
	a set of guidelines regarding how the agile methodologies can be
	adopted, combined and used in these kinds of complex software projects.

  abstract = {Cloud computing enables access to an almost unlimited amount of resources
	combined with usage-based accounting. However, due to their design
	a lot of applications are not able to exploit the elasticity provided
	by the cloud. In this paper, we introduce several mechanisms that
	allow exploitation of the component structure of applications in
	order to scale them in a cloud computing cluster. We present our
	OSGi-inspired component framework COSCA that automatically manages
	elastic deployment of component-based applications. It isolates components
	of different applications and hides distribution using a virtualized
	and distributed OSGi-like framework. We present the results of several
	experiments which show that scalability of component-based applications
	benefits from such a platform. Moreover, we show how lightweight
	and agile component-based scale-out is. Our approach eases the usage
	of cloud resources and scalability for component-based applications.

  abstract = {Automatic code generation is an essential cornerstone of model-driven
	approaches to software development. It closes the gap that emerges
	when models are used to abstract from a concrete software system,
	and thus is to models what compilers are to high-level languages.
	Consequently, the simple and fast development of code generators
	is a key requirement of today's approaches to model-driven development,
	which are increasingly characterized by a strong focus on agility
	and domain-specificity. Currently, many techniques are available
	that support the specification and implementation of code generators,
	such as engines based on templates or rule-based transformations.
	All these techniques have in common that code generators are either
	directly programmed or described by means of textual specifications.
	This monograph presents Genesys, a general approach, which advocates
	the graphical development of code generators for arbitrary source
	and target languages, on the basis of models and services. In particular,
	it is designed to support incremental language development on arbitrary
	metalevels. The use of models allows building of code generators
	in a truly platform-independent and domain-specific way. Furthermore,
	models are amenable to formal verification methods such as model
	checking, which increase the reliability and robustness of the code
	generators. Services enable the reuse and integration of existing
	code generation frameworks and tools regardless of their complexity,
	and at the same time manifest as easy-to-use building blocks that
	facilitate agile development through quick interchangeability. Both
	models and services are reusable and thus form a growing repository
	for the fast creation and evolution of code generators. This book
	shows these and further advantages arising from the Genesys approach
	by means of a full-fledged reference implementation, which has been
	field-tested in a large number of case studies.. © 2013 Springer-Verlag

	of context information available for utilization by context-consuming
	applications, such as those executing on smart mobile devices, sensing
	and tracking platforms, etc. is growing with the increased integration
	of digital artifacts in smart environments. Similarly, the uptake
	of Cloud computing has significantly influenced the traditional information
	processing and infrastructure provision models by offering an agile,
	scalable and cost effective computing paradigm. This is leading to
	the adoption of Cloud-based solutions for the pervasive and ubiquitous

	to be overcome before its exploitation by real world applications

	Significant amount of context consumption, production and processing
	takes place on devices and there is limited or no support for collaborative

	In this paper we propose an environment for context processing in

  abstract = {Hosted software-as-a-service products provide an opportunity to provide
	consumers with continuous deployment of new features, as opposed
	to scheduled version upgrades as is the norm for products installed
	on-premise. In order to exploit this opportunity, a SaaS provider
	needs to adopt an agile process that is capable of releasing new
	features rapidly. The SCRUM [5,6] process is ideally suited for this
	purpose: However, when SCRUM has been used for agile development
	of an installed product, parallel, overlapping 'sprints' are executed
	by separate teams, each dealing with short, medium, and longer-term
	enhancements to the product[3]; with the result that version upgrades
	are therefore easier to manage. In contrast, in the case of a SAAS
	product, version upgrades are no longer a constraint, so we can do
	better. In this paper we describe 'Continuous SCRUM', a variant of
	Type-C SCRUM, augmented with engineering best practices, in a manner
	ideally suited for managing SAAS products. In our approach, bug-fixes,
	minor enhancements, as well as major features are released continuously,
	on a weekly basis by a single team, in contrast to ``Meta-SCRUM{''}
	[3]. We also present field data from our experience with using Continuous
	SCRUM for a hosted platform-as-a-service product for more than two
	years. Our experience reinforces other recent evidence [11] that
	rapid, smaller releases are often preferable to infrequent, larger
	ones. Continuous SCRUM provides a mechanism to achieve and sustain
	a rapid release cycle, for SAAS products as well as, we believe,
	for custom applications developed in-house.},

	a paradigm shift in the design of wireless systems, as it will allow
	the agile and efficient utilization of the radio spectrum by offering

	allows distributed terminals in a wireless network to collaborate

  abstract = {Many large companies, especially those in financial and insurance
	service sectors, approach the market with a decentralized management
	structure, such as by line of business or geographical market segments.
	However, these companies require access to distributed and possibly
	heterogeneous data sources for corporate level decision making. In
	this paper, we focus on challenges of supporting a decision support
	system (DSS) based on a hybrid approach (i.e. a federation system
	with replication of frequently accessed remote data sources) for
	time-sensitive agile business intelligence applications. The response
	time requirement (and a realistic goal) for such a DSS is near real
	time (i.e. 2 ∼ 3 minutes to 20 ∼ 30 minutes). The users of a DSS
	care about not only the response time but also the time stamp of
	the business operation reports since out-dated reports introduce
	uncertainty and risks to decision-making. Thus, the information value
	of a report decreases as time passes. We present a framework of correlation
	aware synchronization of replicas used in DSS to optimize information
	values of business reports as a whole. The framework exploits correlation
	of usage and synchronization latency of replicas in a single query
	and a workload of queries for an optimal synchronization schedule.
	We have conducted extensive evaluations based on both TPC-H and synthetic

	improves up to 50% of information value comparing with fixed synchronization

  note = {cited By (since 1996) 1},
  abstract = {The paper presents a cost reduction methodology to be deployed within
	the procurement function for enabling the more efficient operation
	and cost management of supply chains. Cost CENTRE-ing involves six
	procedural steps of: item Classification; data Encircling; cost driver
	Normalization; parameter Trending; cost Reduction identification;
	negotiated Enforcement. The methodology is applied to industrial
	case studies at Bombardier Aerospace Belfast for validation. The
	case studies embrace a representative range of procured aerospace
	parts in highlighting the generic nature of the method; including
	outside production, raw material and bought-out (vendor specialized)
	systems. The proposed methodology is applied in these three validation
	studies to show that it is effective over a wide range of applications
	(generic), has been used to significantly reduce the cost of supplied
	items (accurate), and is being adopted by a leading aerospace manufacturer
	(relevant). It is concluded that the proposed methodology exhibits
	all the above because it is based on an improved understanding of
	supply chain cost management; thereby contributing to the body of
	knowledge in terms of process understanding; the importance of a
	causal relations in estimating; and identifying inheritance and family
	relations in groups of products. It is shown that the Cost CENTRE-ing
	method provides an agile method for responsive cost analysis, estimation,

  abstract = {In the era of exploding internet usage, social and mobile, enterprises
	are facing both the challenges and business opportunities that are
	introduced by Big Data, which has the characteristics of high volume,
	high velocity, and high variety. Big Data and the emergence of Internet-facing
	workloads will blur the separation between traditional transactional
	and analytics workloads. To extract business value and make actionable
	insight from the unprecedented volume of the data with the agility
	required from the business, it requires transformational innovations
	from many fronts. For example, in data management layer, how unstructured
	data is stored and retrieved efficiently, how data-intensive analytic
	computation can be done on commercial systems effectively, how the
	distributed cache should be designed to make use of the latest network
	protocols so the network-connected memory data can be accessed remotely
	and seamlessly. Moreover, the trend also motivates many architectural
	and technological advancement, such as moving from a transaction-centric
	to a data-centric architecture that supports extreme low and predicable
	latency, massive scale-out, high concurrency, and real-time situational
	awareness and analytics, and that requires orders of magnitude improvement
	over existing systems across each of these characteristics. At the
	same time, new applications in the Mobile and social space leverage
	new open source software stacks written in multiple programming languages,
	e.g., Java, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP, where the developer chooses the
	best tool for the job. How a polyglot runtime platform can be built
	that serves as a best practice platform for the programmers' community
	and in the meantime, optimized for enterprises with elastic, lightweight,
	resilient, agile runtime for business computing. Last, but not least,
	how the benchmarks should be enriched to measure the new runtimes,
	new data-centric systems and architectures.
	
	In this talk, I will talk about some of the research activities at
	IBM Research that addresses these challenges. We examined several
	enterprise-grade java workloads running on commercial multicore systems
	for massive parallelization, identified lock contentions and worked
	towards a streamlined methodology for lock-contention analysis of
	Java workloads. I will use this to describe the excitement around
	node.js framework. I will also talk about our design of data centric
	computing systems, particularly, in the area of data access latency,
	data ingestion, and massive scale-out distributed caching in the
	exemplary context of an eCommerce application. I will describe the
	architecture of a global secondary index to greatly improve data
	access latency of Hadoop Database (HBase), an open-source key-value
	distributed datastore. I will describe an innovative distributed
	caching system that exploits low latency interconnects to utilize
	hash maps of data keys on each server for local lookup while data
	resides and are accessed across clustered systems. The distributed
	cache can achieves 100 to 1000-fold performance gain over many caching
	methods. Last, I will talk about our early activities in developing
	technologies for an elastic, scalable, resilient polyglot runtime
	system. I will conclude with my views on the challenges for benchmarking
	community for next decade.},

	Besides the need for hardware reconfigurability and the capability
	to sense spectrum opportunities, adaptability in the MAC designs
	is required so that the wireless communication systems can support

	a MAC design framework enabling fast composition of MAC protocols

	Our design is based on the decomposition principle and allows on-the-fly
	realization of the required MAC protocol from a set of basic functional
	components. By exposing extended metadata and hardware functionalities
	for the MAC implementation through our granular components, together
	with the support for run-time re-configuration, spectrum agile and
	cognitive MAC solutions can be easily realized. We validate our approach
	through realization of a few MAC solutions on the WARP board originally
	from Rice University, USA. We also demonstrate the ease of MAC realization,
	fast real-time adaptation based on the spectral characteristics and

  abstract = {On the surface, model-driven architecture (MDA) appears to be a fundamentally
	new paradigm compared to traditional software development. Upon closer
	examination, however, MDA mainly shifts the focus of iterative development
	to a higher level of abstraction. The traditional waterfall software
	development process (and its variations) dictates that the system
	development be driven by low-level design and coding. This can introduce
	many productivity, maintenance and documentation issues into the
	process. Using the MDA pushes development to a higher level, where
	platform-independent analysis and detailed platform-specific design
	modeling make it easier to trace back to the requirements, thereby
	introducing a more stringent governance over the project. Also, it
	introduces a technology and platform independent standardized development
	process, system interoperability internally as well as the ability
	to provide communication bridges with external systems. The systems
	can be portable, which allows for what the creators of the MDA, the
	object management group (OMG), refer to as ``future proofing{''}
	of software systems. This is the ability to have long-lived models
	that can be applied to any new implementation technologies that will
	ultimately be created and introduced to the software development
	world. This paper seeks to introduce and demystify MDA concepts and
	features, and show how their application can be used to develop highly
	interoperable and robust medical device software systems. In particular,
	if medical devices are designed using the MDA approach, they can
	quickly be adapted to utilize any interoperability (or ``plug and
	play{''}) standard that evolves in the future.},

	most important characteristics were (1) the adoption of a hybrid
	agile methodology incorporating the best practices in both coding
	and project management drawn from three established agile methodologies,
	and (2) the introduction of requirement shocks at appropriate junctures
	to train students to react to changes in business requirements. The
	effectiveness of the course design was assessed using objective measures
	of learning operationalized as the numerical scores obtained by students.

	useful to examine the roots of design in an effort to re-interpret
	many of the original ideas. In this paper, we shall briefly study
	significant contributions to decision-making, systems theory, project
	management, behavioral science and organization theory, as well as
	business aspects. To further understand the nature of design, we
	shall discuss key features, such as purposeful intent based on a
	stakeholder approach, situational approach, integration of subsystems,
	perspectives and time horizons, the design process, and modeling.
	Recent developments, e.g. in design science, design thinking, managing
	as designing, participatory design, and agile project management,
	have provided a number of new approaches that in many ways represent
	answers to the challenges of increased uncertainty and complexity.
	This has led to the development of seven propositions: • Understanding
	mutual interplay of actors - unveiling self-sustaining informal learning
	processes • Involving stakeholders - clarifying who wants to see
	the design succeed • Accepting diversity - working with several perspectives
	in parallel • Experimenting with new ideas - establishing a playful
	and creative mood among participants • Enacting key features of new
	systems design - involving users in testing a series of prototypes
	• Including the organizational context - orchestrating a design effort
	in view of simultaneous development initiatives and top management's
	shifting agenda • Acknowledging that the intentions of an enterprise
	information system are realized through people - An enterprise information
	system only sets the stage for organizational processes. If adopted
	in an enterprise, management will be challenged to carry out design
	activities in a radically different way. © 2012 IFIP International

  abstract = {For the past decades, programmable logic controllers (PLC's) using
	relay ladder logic (RLL) programming have been the workhorse for
	controlling event-driven industrial automated systems. RLL proved
	flexible compared to the hardwired RLL control implementation, due
	to its feature of software implementation. As automated systems become
	more complex, they also become more difficult to understand and maintain.
	It takes tremendous effort to accommodate specification changes,
	which become frequent, to meet today's flexible and agile automation
	needs. Several methods emerge to overcome the shortcomings of RLL.
	Petri nets (PN's), initially proposed as a modeling tool, have been
	developed as such a method. This paper adopts an industrial scale
	system to compare RLL and PN design methods so that the advantages
	of PN-like approaches are fully recognized. The criteria are the
	understandability that relates to the ability to evaluate the programmed
	logic, to verify its correctness, and to maintain the control system
	as well as the flexibility that relates to the easy modification
	of logic when the specification changes. To the authors' knowledge,
	this is the first work that takes an existing industrial system,
	conducts discrete event control designs by using both RLL programming
	and PN methods, and performs a comparative study on them. Together
	with the previous comparison results through small-scale systems,
	the results of this study support that PN-like advanced discrete
	event control design methods are better than RLL, in terms of the
	understandability and flexibility of a resulting control design.

  abstract = {Today's competitive market demands immediate attention on security
	issues for developing secure software system. Security must be an
	integral part of any application development methodology. It becomes
	more challenging when developers design projects according to agile
	methodology. Traditional ways of development are sequential considering
	major changes during analysis. Agile methodology is required as there
	is a need for an iterative approach which encourages changes in requirements
	at any stage in software development lifecycle. In this paper, we
	are presenting a framework which effectively implements security
	practices in agile development and adopts additional features proposed
	by other researchers. The key point in our framework is that we are
	embedding a hybrid technique for requirement elicitation with Agile
	Software Development (ASD). This technique would combine abuser stories
	and attack trees drawing best features of each of their individual
	methods. This hybrid technique maps security threats found during
	security requirements effectively as compared to individual techniques.

	used in such context. It has been argued that pair programming in

	are going to feed the accounting systems and support decisions of
	the operation and analysis teams. In order to improve data reconciliation

	necessary to treat raw data that come from site and were recorded
	in the refinery information systems. The software developed has a
	function of capture raw data record in the system of registration
	and control of operations and link these data with measurements in
	the refining processes. This pooling of information brings a gain
	of quantity and quality to the data reconciliation system, reducing
	mathematical problems of non-solubility drive by configuration of
	refining processes and allocation of measurements. The software also
	evaluates the closing of balance sheet of each tank and carries a
	previous distribution of differences, which come from low precision
	of measurements. This functionality of system intended that data
	were as close to reality of the process as possible and also attend
	accounting requirements, increasingly rigid, imposed to oil refining
	companies. To achieve this goal, it was made modifications on a consecrated
	numerical technique, in order to adapt this to the problem and to

	and occur automatically in hours previously scheduled. With the data

  abstract = {Robotic fingers, which are the key parts of robot hand, are divided
	into two main kinds: dexterous fingers and under-actuated fingers.
	Although dexterous fingers are agile, they are too expensive. Under-actuated
	fingers can grasp objects self-adaptively, which makes them easy
	to control and low cost, on the contrary, under-actuated function
	makes fingers feel hard to grasp things agilely enough and make many
	gestures. For the purpose of designing a new finger which can grasp
	things dexterously, perform many gestures and feel easy to control
	and maintain, a concept called ``gesture-changeable under-actuated{''}
	(GCUA) function is put forward. The GCUA function combines the advantages
	of dexterous fingers and under-actuated fingers: a pre-bending function
	is embedded into the under-actuated finger. The GCUA finger can not
	only perform self-adaptive grasping function, but also actively bend
	the middle joint of the finger. On the basis of the concept, a GCUA
	finger with 2 joints is designed, which is realized by the coordination
	of screw-nut transmission mechanism, flexible drawstring constraint
	and pulley-belt under-actuated mechanism. Principle analyses of its
	grasping and the design optimization of the GCUA finger are given.
	An important problem of how to stably grasp an object which is easy
	to glide is discussed. The force analysis on gliding object in grasping
	process is introduced in detail. A GCUA finger with 3 joints is developed.
	Many experiments of grasping different objects by of the finger were
	carried out. The experimental results show that the GCUA finger can
	effectively realize functions of pre-bending and self-adaptive grasping,
	the grasping processes are stable. The GCUA finger excels under-actuated
	fingers in dexterity and gesture actions and it is easier to control
	and cheaper than dexterous hands, becomes the third kinds of finger.

  abstract = {Crowdsourcing is an increasingly used model to outsource certain tasks
	to be carried out by external experts on the Web. Especially when
	lacking experience or expertise with certain task types, crowdsourcing
	offers a convenient way to receive instant support. In this paper,
	we introduce an in-house enterprise crowdsourcing model, which leverages
	the crowdsourcing concept and transfers it to traditional organizations.
	Here, a company's staff is considered a crowd that-besides its regularly
	assigned tasks-can also receive tasks from colleagues from other
	departments and across hierarchical structures. The aim is to offer
	instant support and utilize free capacities throughout a large organization
	more efficiently. In our work, we describe this concept and supporting
	mechanisms in context of an agile software development use case.
	However, in contrast to usually crowdsourced microtasks, complex
	software architectures usually consist of tens and hundreds of connected
	modules that can be potentially crowdsourced. These technical dependencies
	between modules require active coordination and interactions between
	crowd members that process the single artifacts. Hence, technical
	dependencies of artifacts result in social dependencies of collaborating
	crowd members that create them. In order to efficiently discover
	member compositions based on artifact dependencies, we introduce
	an indexing and discovery approach based on subgraph matching. Typically,
	assigning tasks to well-rehearsed teams results in more reliable
	task processing, faster results, and higher quality of work. We evaluate
	our approach in terms of system scalability and overall applicability
	by mining and analyzing the popular SourceForge community. We show
	that our approach of member composition discovery is feasibly in
	terms of scalability and quality of discovery results. Our findings
	deliver important input for the design and implementation of supporting
	information systems for future large-scale collaboration platforms.

	these challenges by developing a collaborative workflow model in
	a team with mixed technical skills. Design/methodology/approach:
	The paper offers a case study of one library's effort to transform
	inefficient web development processes in the digital library unit
	into an agile, collaborative team workflow through the development
	of a tool (dmBridge) that helps to reduce redundancies and encourage
	cooperation in the digital library design process. Findings: dmBridge
	came about in response to the growing necessity to create a sustainable
	digital library workflow within a framework capable of accommodating
	advanced customizability and relatively simple web development for
	CONTENTdm digital collections. Practical implications: As libraries
	seek to extend technology and digitization partnerships and cultivate
	successful grant funding, the authors demonstrate how development
	of tools like dmBridge can deliver an improved user experience, boost
	project efficiency, and support the strategic goals of the institution.
	Originality/value: dmBridge fills a need for a more modern, feature-rich,
	customizable digital collections framework. In doing so, it has brought
	about a considerable transformation in digitization projects workflow

	muscles of the eye has been of considerable interest, particularly
	to researchers working on adaptations of the vestibulo-ocular reflex.
	Here we offer the first, extensive comparative analysis of the spatial
	relationships between each extraocular muscle and the canal providing
	its primary excitatory stimulus. The sample consisted of 113 specimens,
	representing 51 extant mammalian species. Hypotheses tested included
	that variations in the spatial alignments are linked with differences
	of skull morphology and with differences of agility during locomotion.
	Internal morphologies were visualized with magnetic resonance imaging
	and were measured with landmark-based vectors and planes. Values
	for body mass and agility were taken from the existing literature.
	Data were investigated for trends and associations with standard
	bivariate and multivariate statistical methods as well as with phylogenetically
	adjusted bivariate methods. The findings clearly show that species
	differences in the alignment of each extraocular muscle relative
	to the canal providing its primary excitatory stimulus are closely
	associated with changes of orbit morphology. The results also indicate
	that the actions of the oblique muscles interchange with those of
	the superior and inferior recti muscles when comparing lateral-eyed
	(rabbit) with frontal-eyed species (cat). There was only weak evidence
	to support the notion that canal-muscle alignments differ significantly
	among species according to how agile they are. The results suggest
	that semicircular canal morphology is arranged primarily for detecting
	head movements and then secondarily, if at all, for diminishing the
	burden of transforming vestibulo-ocular reflex signals in the most
	agile species. © 2010 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2010 Anatomical

  abstract = {Task-based workflows describe a set of predefined tasks executed in

	The increasingly agile nature of business processes implies that
	neither the potential tasks nor their sequence flow can be defined

	in a business process execution while services are stateless entities.
	While business goals and associated business rules drive models and

	be used to determine how the document can be processed and how multiple
	processing tasks may be composed dynamically. This paper introduces
	a document-based workflow model that implements such agile business
	processes. The described approach relies on the use of a rule-based

  abstract = {Context: Agile software development with its emphasis on producing
	working code through frequent releases, extensive client interactions
	and iterative development has emerged as an alternative to traditional
	plan-based software development methods. While a number of case studies
	have provided insights into the use and consequences of agile, few
	empirical studies have examined the factors that drive the adoption
	and use of agile. Objective: We draw on intention-based theories
	and a dialectic perspective to identify factors driving the use of
	agile practices among adopters of this software development methodology.
	Method: Data for the study was gathered through an anonymous online
	survey of software development professionals. We requested participation
	from members of a selected list of online discussion groups, and
	received 98 responses. Results: Our analyses reveal that subjective
	norm and training play a significant role in influencing software
	developers' use of agile processes and methods, while perceived benefits
	and perceived limitations are not primary drivers of agile use among
	adopters. Interestingly, perceived benefit emerges as a significant
	predictor of agile use only if adopters face hindrances to their
	agile practices. Conclusion: We conclude that research in the adoption
	of software development innovations should examine the effects of
	both enabling and detracting factors and the interactions between
	them. Since training, subjective norm, and the interplay between
	perceived benefits and perceived hindrances appear to be key factors
	influencing the adoption of agile methods, researchers can focus
	on how to (a) perform training on agile methods more effectively,
	(b) facilitate the dialog between developers and managers about perceived
	benefits and hindrances, and (c) capitalize on subjective norm to
	publicize the benefits of agile methods within an organization. Further,
	when managing the transition to new software development methods,
	we recommend that practitioners adapt their strategies and tactics
	contingent on the extent of perceived hindrances to the change. ©

	widely adopting test-driven development. Despite its name, ``test
	driven{''} or ``test first{''} development isn't really a testing
	technique. Also known as test-driven design, TDD works like this:
	For each small bit of functionality the programmers code, they first
	write unit tests. Then they write the code that makes those unit
	tests pass. This forces the programmer to think about many aspects
	of the feature before coding it. It also provides a safety net of
	tests that the programmers can run with each update to the code,
	ensuring that refactored, updated, or new code doesn't break existing
	functionality},

	The objective of this study was to assess the role of these elements
	using creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus) in the Mastigouche Wildlife
	Reserve (Québec, Canada) as model. Numerous impassable waterfalls
	and interconnections among drainage systems were inferred with geographic
	information systems and confirmed de visu. The analysis of 32 populations
	using seven nuclear microsatellites revealed the presence of three
	genetically distinct groups. Some groups were found upstream of impassable
	barriers and in adjacent portions of distinct drainage systems. Admixture
	among groups was also detected in some populations. Constraining
	phylogenetic procedures as well as Mantel correlation tests confirmed
	that the genetic structure is more likely to result from interconnections
	between the drainage systems than from the permanent network. This
	study indicates that landscape elements such as interconnections
	are of major importance for circumventing impassable barriers and
	colonizing lakes that are otherwise inaccessible. Such an approach
	could be relevant for determining the origins of fish species (i.e.
	native vs. introduced) in the context of conservation. © 2009 Blackwell

  abstract = {Distributed systems aren't only more widespread than they used to
	be, but they've become more critical than ever, having moved from
	client-server systems to multitier heterogeneous systems. Many of
	these applications - such as telephone exchange systems - must be
	operational 24 hours a day, so shutting them down isn't a viable
	option for administrators who must make systemwide changes. As a
	system becomes larger and more complex, the likelihood of defects
	increases, which means a greater number of required fixes. Studies
	have found that nearly half the software development effort in complex
	distributed systems is devoted to maintenance. Furthermore, the industry
	currently favors iterative and incremental development approaches
	over the traditional waterfall approach in software engineering to
	flexibly handle requirements and reduce project risks by deploying
	smaller changes. These changes are regular and predictable. So, how
	can we build distributed systems to handle these kinds of changes?
	The answer, we argue, is dynamic evolution. From a business perspective,
	dynamic evolution permits frequent upgrades, which reduces the time
	between releases. Dynamic evolution also enhances flexibility in
	implementing changes to unforeseen and fluctuating business requirements.
	Many specialized distributed systems will benefit from factoring
	dynamic evolution into their designs. We can easily achieve dynamic
	evolution in a component-based distributed system. The abstraction
	of components and their connectors facilitates system structures
	to accommodate changes.},

  note = {cited By (since 1996) 1},
  abstract = {Agile software development has challenged the traditional ways of
	delivering software as it provides a very different approach to software
	development. In recent decades, software process improvement (SPI)
	has been widely studied in the context of traditional software development,
	and its strengths and weaknesses have been recognised. As organisations
	increasingly adopt agile software development methodologies to be
	used alongside traditional methodologies, new challenges and opportunities
	for SPI are also emerging. One challenge is that traditional SPI
	methods often emphasise the continuous improvement of organisational
	software development processes, whereas the principles of agile software
	development focus on iterative adaptation and improvement of the
	activities of individual software development teams to increase effectiveness.
	The focus of this thesis is twofold. The first goal is to study how
	agile software development teams can conduct SPI, according to the
	values, principles and practices of agile software development, in
	tandem with the success factors of traditional SPI. The second goal
	is to study how the team-centred SPI of agile software development
	and the traditional view of organisational improvement can be integrated
	to co-exist in a mutually-beneficial manner in software development
	organisations. The main research methodology in this thesis is action
	research (AR). The empirical data is taken from six agile software
	development case projects. The results of this research have been
	published in a total of seven conference, and journal, papers. The
	principal result of the study of project level SPI is an Iterative
	Improvement Process which provides systematic, yet agile, SPI mechanisms
	for agile software development teams. This process iteratively evolved
	during the series of case projects. The empirical evidence of the
	project level research demonstrates the ability and willingness of
	agile software development teams to iteratively improve their daily
	working practices by making minor and simple, yet effective and visible,
	improvements during their projects. The research data further indicates
	the positive effect of iterative team reflection on the satisfaction
	of project teams, and confirms the need for systematic mechanisms
	to carry out SPI activities in agile project teams. Furthermore,
	the data shows that external support for the improvement activities
	proved to be highly significant for the success of SPI within agile
	project teams. The study of organizational SPI initially focused
	on integrating agile software development and continuous improvement
	of existing organisational practices. Arising from this stage, several
	changes to traditional SPI activities were suggested in order to
	establish a mutually-beneficial co-existence between organisational
	SPI stakeholders and agile software development teams. During the
	research a framework for deploying agile practices in organisations
	was developed. In this novel framework, the Iterative Improvement
	Process provides a mechanism for feedback between the agile software
	development teams and continuous organisational improvement activities.
	The research data further indicates that documented and validated
	knowledge arising from the Iterative Improvement Processes of agile
	software development teams can be beneficial in other contexts, such
	as in analysing and establishing future SPI initiatives in software
	development organisations. Copyright © VTT Technical Research Centre

	sources of information should be included in the requirements engineering
	process, contextual environment concerns and architectural patterns
	and heuristics. To account for these two sources of implicit requirements
	information we introduce the concept of forward and backward inferred
	macro-architectural requirements. Forward inferred macro-architectural
	requirements are elicited from contextual environment concerns. Backward
	inferred macro-architectural requirements are extracted through a
	reverse requirements elicitation process from architectural heuristics
	and patterns. We have observed significant improvements in the efficiency
	of the development processes and the quality of the final software
	products as a result of making inferred macro-architectural requirements

  abstract = {The role of the Contract Data Requirements List [CDRL] in the DoD
	acquisition process is to provide the authoritative list of required
	artifacts for a given procurement. It forms an appendix to the acquisition
	contract, and includes delivery information and a schedule for each,
	typically mapped to milestone events such as the Preliminary Design
	Review [PDR] or the Critical Design Review [CDR] in the DoD Acquisition
	Waterfall Lifecycle. A number of CDRLs were proposed for the Joint
	Mission Planning Systems [JMPS] Framework, including a number of
	artifacts specific to the architecture and design of the application.
	Alignment with the DoD Acquisition Waterfall Lifecycle milestone
	events posed significant challenges to the program, given the contractor's
	proposed Agile development methodology. Many of these architectural
	and design documents carried a delivery-schedule expectation that
	placed them in conflict with the best practices and anticipated benefits
	of Agile, including the principle of #x201C;design only as much as
	is necessary to build features #x201D;. Using the Enterprise Architect
	tool, the contractor was able to produce a #x201C;living design #x201D;
	used daily by the development team, including architects, designers,
	developers, integrators, and testers. The tool provided capabilities
	that facilitated templates for various CDRLs, including the Systems

	and the Interface Design Description [IDD], allowing on-demand generation
	of snapshots of the architecture and detailed design as it evolved,
	providing the appropriate level of documentation of the as-built
	system. The result better addressed the contractual intent of the
	CDRLs, to provide subsequent platform developers an accurate and
	up-to-date understanding of the architecture and design of the JMPS
	Framework, while better preserving the integrity of the development
	of the Enterprise Architecture within the selected Zachman Fram-

	The gap between business models and enterprise software applications
	is bridged by a Java-based software framework that executes business

	model is implemented as a thin client application. The software framework
	enables rapid spiral development of short-term cycles because business

	have major flaws since `theory-only' fails to highlight the practical
	dimension and empirical learning exposes the organization to damageable

  abstract = {Modern software development methods such as Extreme Programming (XP)
	favor the use of frequently repeated tests, so-called regression
	tests, to catch new errors when software is updated or tuned, by
	checking that the software still produces the right results for a
	reference input. Regression testing is also very valuable for Extract-Transform-Load
	(ETL) software, as ETL software tends to be very complex and error-prone.
	However, regression testing of ETL software is currently cumbersome
	and requires large manual efforts. In this paper, we describe a novel,
	easy-to-use, and efficient semi-automatic test framework for regression
	test of ETL software. By automatically analyzing the schema, the
	tool detects how tables are related, and uses this knowledge, along
	with optional user specifications, to determine exactly what data
	warehouse (DW) data should be identical across test ETL runs, leaving
	out change-prone values such as surrogate keys. The framework also
	provides tools for quickly detecting and displaying differences between
	the current ETL results and the reference results. In summary, manual
	work for test setup is reduced to a minimum, while still ensuring
	an efficient testing procedure. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg

  abstract = {The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has recently
	begun an effort to further refine its Fractionated Spacecraft vision.
	This vision (called the ``F6{''} program) seeks to explore distributed
	spacecraft architectures capable of performing complex functions
	similar to current monolithic spacecrafts. However, the ability of
	fractionated systems to work separately would provide significant
	benefits not achievable by monolithic systems. The question of interest
	to this study was ``Can these benefits be quantified and evaluated
	in a meaningful fashion in order to compare them to monolithic architectures?{''}
	Rather than narrowing the approach to one or two concepts, the strategy
	was to expand the decision space in order to generate and evaluate
	a variety of alternatives under different scenarios and design choices.
	The stimuli were specifically selected to capture many issues not
	included in such studies such as technology obsolescence, funding
	profile changes, equipment failure scenarios, and even changes to
	mission objectives during the mission. Each stimulus has a variety
	of decision options or responses which a manager can exercise including
	delay, cancellation, acceleration of a development, or even new developments.
	It is argued that the very nature of fractionation will result in
	systems far more agile to external (and internal) stimuli, but this
	has never been shown explicitly. This study explores the use of Real
	Options in conjunction with traditional Net Present Value techniques
	to quantify the desirability of alternative candidate designs in
	terms of their adaptability and survivability. Our approach to evaluating
	the business case for each use case was to explicitly model both
	the implementation and operation phases for the life cycle of a fractionated
	cluster. The models were integrated into Phoenix Integration's ModelCenter
	#x00AE; framework and used to generate Implementation Value Metrics
	(IVMs) and Operational Value Metrics (OVMs) associated w- th the
	use cases under evaluation. A number of models were developed to
	support these evaluations using Excel, Matlab, and Arena #x00AE;
	(a commercial discrete-event simulation software product). The Model-Based
	Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach used in this study yielded transformations
	between high-level frameworks (OWL and SysML) and the models used
	to generate the data we needed for the evaluation. This rule-based
	transformation process will be critical for exploring the large decision
	trade spaces in a reasonable amount of time. This paper presents
	the results of the business case analyses; the underlying OVM's and
	IVM's, the approaches used to model the problem, explore the tradespace,
	refine the exploration, and generate results. We also discuss possible
	directions for future work. Specifically, it should be noted that
	while the approach described herein is being developed for, and funded
	by, DARPA, it has general applicability to a much wider variety of
	applications.},

	of an industry sponsor who served as the customer. The course followed

	Among the three teams were two experimental groups. One group consisted
	of two teams that applied a Test-First (TDD) methodology, while a
	control group applied a traditional Test-Last methodology. Unlike
	Test-First, the tests in Test-Last are written after the design and
	construction of the production code being tested Results from this
	experiment differ from many previous studies. In particular, the
	Test-Last team was actually more productive and wrote more tests
	than their Test-First counterparts. Anecdotal evidence suggests that
	factors other than development approach such as individual ambition
	and team motivation may have more affect than the development approach
	applied. Although more students indicated a preference for the Test-First
	approach, concerns regarding learning and applying TDD with unfamiliar

  abstract = {Many software-development organizations have recently started to adopt

	However, in a large, distributed organization, such as Nokia Siemens

	and therefore, evaluating the benefits achieved, and measuring the
	success of the change, can be difficult, especially in the early

	of a case study on the impact introducing agile practices actually
	had in a large, software-development organization, part of Nokia
	Siemens Networks. The impact of this agile transformation was evaluated
	in terms of how well it succeeded in achieving the goals set by the
	management before the transformation started. This longitudinal study
	included two separate analyses, made at 6 monthly intervals, which
	measured what agile practices were really in use in the organization,
	and what effects, if any, were visible in terms of the goals which
	had been set by the management The 6 monthly analyses included defect
	data metrics and opinion surveys of the personnel directly involved
	in the transformation. The study showed two things: firstly, that
	the introduction of agile practices does have the beneficial effects
	that one would expect, and secondly, that, using this kind of study,
	it is not only possible to evaluate the impact that the adoption
	of agile practices has in a large, established software-development

	structured methods, which have evolved and expanded over time to
	embrace consortia/company-led initiatives such as the Unified Modeling
	Language and the Unified Process alongside formal process improvement
	frameworks such as the International Standards Organization's 9000
	series, the Capability Maturity Model and SPICE. More recently, the
	philosophy behind traditional plan-based initiatives has been questioned
	by the agile movement, which seeks to emphasize the human and craft
	aspects of software development over and above the engineering aspects.
	Agile practice is strongly collaborative in its outlook, favoring
	individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software
	over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract
	negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan (see
	Sidebar 1). Early experience reports on the use of agile practice
	suggest some success in dealing with the problems of the software
	crisis, and suggest that plan-based and agile practice are not mutually
	exclusive. Indeed, flexibility may arise from this unlikely marriage
	in an aim to strike a balance between the rigor of traditional plan-based
	approaches and the need for adaptation of those to suit particular
	development situations. With this in mind, this article surveys the
	current practice in software engineering alongside perceptions of
	senior development managers in relation to agile practice in order
	to understand the principles of agility that may be practiced implicitly
	and their effects on plan-based approach. © 2010 ACM.},

	The challenges we have faced comes from three different dimensions.
	First is to address the issue of having an agile team split across
	two different countries. The second is to execute the agile project
	within the framework prescribed under CMMI. Here the challenge is
	not only to address the actual gap between CMMI and agile methodologies
	but also to address the perceived shortcomings of agile methodologies.
	The third dimension is to execute the project as a fixed price one
	where the requirement is not frozen at the beginning of the project.
	We have listed the challenges that we have faced. They can be categorized
	under requirements management, contract management, team management,
	distributed working, when to design, role of a specialist, testing
	challenges and CMMI adherence. The different solutions tried and

  abstract = {The influence of density differences on the mixing of the primary
	loop inventory and the emergency core cooling (ECC) water in the
	cold leg and downcomer of a pressurized water reactor (PWR) was analyzed
	at the Rossendorf coolant mixing (ROCOM) test facility. This paper
	presents a matrix of ROCOM experiments in which water with the same
	or higher density, was injected into a cold leg of the reactor model
	with already established natural circulation conditions at different
	low mass flow rates. Wire-mesh sensors measuring the concentration
	of a tracer in the injected water were installed in the cold leg,
	upper and lower part of the downcomer A transition matrix from momentum
	to buoyancy-driven flow experiments was selected for validation of
	the computational fluid dynamics software ANSYS CFX. A hybrid mesh
	with 4 X 106 elements was used for the calculations. The turbulence
	models usually applied in such cases assume that turbulence is isotropic,
	whilst buoyancy actually induces anisotropy Thus, in this paper,
	higher order turbulence models have been developed and implemented,
	which take into account that anisotropy. Buoyancy generated source
	and dissipation terms were proposed and introduced into the balance
	equations for the turbulent kinetic energy. The results of the experiments
	and of the numerical calculations show that mixing strongly depends
	on buoyancy effects: At higher mass flow rates (close to nominal
	conditions) the injected slug propagates in the circumferential direction
	around the core barrel. Buoyancy effects reduce this circumferential
	propagation with lower mass flow rates and/or higher density differences.
	The ECC waterfalls in an almost vertical path and reaches the lower
	downcomer sensor directly below the inlet nozzle. Therefore, density
	effects play an important role during natural convection with the
	ECC injection in PWR and should be also considered in pressurized
	thermal shock scenarios. ANSYS CFX was able to predict the observed
	flow patterns and mixing phenomena quite well. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.2983137]},

  abstract = {Purpose: Agile methods have proven successful in increasing customer
	satisfaction and decreasing time and cost to market under uncertain
	conditions. Key characteristics of agile methods are lean, flexibility
	and highly iterative development with a strong emphasis on stakeholder
	involvement. Today construction firms in general and small to medium-sized
	enterprises (SMEs) in particular are surviving in a drastic competitive
	environment in which they are facing more and more challenges. Additional
	innovation is needed in the construction sector, with increased participation
	from more competitive SMEs. The main purpose of this paper is to
	present a model to prioritize available management systems to help
	SMEs address the challenge of today's market competition more effectively.
	Design/methodology/approach: The research methodology used is that
	of interpretative case study and grounded theory based on a strong
	empirical foundation, on which new theoretical insight into knowledge
	management as an autonomous action is developed. The paper looks
	at ways by which SMEs are managed, based on the empirical data collected
	from 12 case studies. It presents the empirical findings drawn from
	the case studies. Finally, the adoption of agile methods is subjectively
	assessed as to its potential contribution for improving the business
	processes of small and medium construction firms. Findings: It is
	assessed that agile methods offers considerable potential for application
	in construction SMEs and that there are significant hurdles to its
	adoption in the actual phase. Should these be overcome, agile methods
	offers benefits well beyond any individual company. Practical implications:
	Construction firms need to be aware of the advantages of new management
	paradigms and practices. The analysis shows that SMEs in the construction
	sector have to internalize agile values into their business processes
	to reap the benefits of agile methods. It also reveals that existing
	practices show some kind of agile flavours. Originality/value: Agile
	principles and methods are explored, including: philosophy, values,
	practices and benefits. The management approaches used by construction
	SMEs are analyzed and discussed. The paper presents recommendations
	and insights for enhancing the performance and efficiency of SMEs
	by adopting agile values in their business processes. © Emerald Group

	- Working software over comprehensive documentation.
	
	- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.

  note = {cited By (since 1996) 0},
  abstract = {Both agile software development and lean architecture have been studied
	in the software engineering field. Combining these two approaches
	has also been investigated. However, the existing research and practices
	only present the principles but fail to develop a framework of the
	software development for practitioners to follow. In this paper,
	a framework about how naïve agile practices could be fulfilled by
	introducing ``lean{''} practices under the DCI (Data-Context-Interaction)
	paradigm is proposed. Lean practice is an end-user-focused and value-centric
	system design. In the proposed framework, lean architecture is complementary
	to agile principles and disciplines and supports agile development.
	This paper is exploring the possibilities of how agile methods can
	restore its lost insights and possibly be reinforced by lean thinking.
	Meanwhile, it is also examined what lean can do ``beyond{''} agile.
	A new lean approach to building domain architecture comes from Data-Context-Interaction
	(DCI) paradigm which facilitates to represent the domain architecture
	intuitively. DCI approach allows us to successfully decouple between
	domain and business-logic features and provides an approach for lean
	practitioners to design system architecture much closer to the real-world
	domain. It is claimed that the investment into lean and agile methodologies
	go hand in hand from organizational to technical aspects by tying
	up with lean concepts as the backbone for agile methods. How lean
	makes it right and how agile makes it fast with the DCI paradigm
	will be demonstrated with an example. The main contribution to the
	software development will be presented. © 2012 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Refactoring is the process of applying behavior-preserving transformations
	to a program with the objective of improving the program's design.
	A specific refactoring is identified by a name (e.g., Extract Method),
	a set of preconditions, and a set of specific transformations that
	need to be performed. Tool support for refactoring is highly desirable
	because checking the preconditions for a given refactoring often
	requires nontrivial program analysis, and applying the transformations
	may affect many locations throughout a program. In recent years,
	the emergence of light-weight programming methodologies such as Extreme
	Programming has generated a great amount of interest in refactoring,
	and refactoring support has become a required feature in modern-day
	IDEs. This workshop is a continuation of a series of previous workshops
	(ECOOP 2007, OOPSLA 2008 and 2009, ICSE 2011 - see http://refactoring.info/WRT)

  note = {cited By (since 1996) 0},
  abstract = {Enterprise2.0 is the use of emergent social software tools to improve
	knowledge sharing and collaboration within and between firms, their
	customers and partners. This paper proposes that Enterprise2.0 is
	a double-edged sword and should be adopted cautiously. Emerging trends
	in e-business are specialisation and collaboration, creating a diverse
	population of organisations, each tightly defined by its core competences,
	interacting in a constant sequence of transient relationships, each
	motivated by a particular market opportunity. These dynamic business
	networks depend on the establishment of appropriate platforms and
	global standards to enable smooth interaction between the service
	components, in particular, appropriate metadata such as ontologies.
	The dynamism of such an interconnected yet free-wheeling economy
	is constrained unless risks relating to investment in a new business
	relationship are reduced to levels where the risk-reward ratio favours
	agility rather than inertia. For its advocates, Enterprise2.0 techniques
	promise to contribute to the evolution of dynamic, agile, collaborative
	e-commerce. However, its egalitarian and permissive nature creates
	challenges. Folksonomies allow a more customer-centric view of an
	organisation's value proposition but may also undermine carefully
	devised official ontologies. Collaborative filtering may provide
	a mechanism for mitigating risk but the trust created is dependent
	upon the perceived credibility of the reviewers. A high profile example
	of an initiative designed to facilitate dynamic e-commerce which
	failed due to unsatisfactory classification of its members and the
	perceived risk of interacting with unknown reputations is examined.
	Recent academic research and practical applications that address
	these conflicts are reviewed.},

	can be used in FM based developments. Additionally, other essential
	pieces like test first, incremental development and refactoring can

	those pieces: when you write a formal specification you are saying
	what your code must do, when you write a test you are doing the same
	so the idea is to use formal specifications as tests. Incremental
	development is quite similar to the refinement process in FM: specifications
	evolve to code maintaining previous functionality. Finally FM can
	help to remove redundancy, eliminate unused functionality and transform
	obsolete designs into new ones, and this is refactoring. © Springer-Verlag

	an assessment according to one Process Model to other models and
	determines what capability/maturity according to different Process

  abstract = {We introduce a new kind of diagnostic sensor that combines multifunctional
	measurement capabilities for ionospheric research. Multifunctionality
	is realized through agility in frequency selection over an extended
	band (1.5 to 50 MHz), system modularity, complete system control
	by software written in C, and a user-friendly computer interface.
	This sensor, which we call the frequency-agile radar (FAR), incorporates
	dual radar channels and an arbitrary waveform synthesizer that allows
	creative design of sophisticated waveforms as a means of increasing
	its sensitivity to weak signals while minimizing loss in radar resolution.
	The sensitivity of the FAR is determined by two sets of power amplifier
	modules: four 4-kW solid-state broadband amplifiers, and four 30-kW
	vacuum tube amplifiers. FAR control is by an AT-bus personal computer
	with on-line processing by a programmable array processor. The FAR
	does not simply house the separate functions of most radio sensors
	in use today, it provides convenient and flexible access to those
	functions as elements to be used in any combination. Some of the
	first new results obtained with the FAR during recent field campaigns
	are presented to illustrate its versatility. These include (1) the
	first detection of anomalous high-frequency (HF) reflections from
	a barium ion cloud, (2) the first evidence of unexpectedly large
	drifts and a shear north of the equatorial electrojet, (3) the first
	HF radar signature of a developing equatorial plasma bubble, and
	(4) the first measurements by a portable radar of altitude-extended,
	quasi-periodic backscatter from midlatitude sporadic E. We also mention
	the potential of the FAR for atmospheric remote sensing.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Many organizations are outsourcing their information technology
	(IT) related services to a third party vendor for quite some time.
	However, the IT services industry including outsourcing is going
	through rapid changes with the increasing adoption of Cloud computing.
	The purpose of this paper is to compare global IT outsourcing with
	Cloud computing along with the evolution of traditional IT services.
	Design/methodology/approach: Cloud computing is a model for provisioning
	and consuming IT capabilities on a need and pay by use basis. This
	helps in shifting the cost structure from capital expenditure to
	operating expenditure and also helps the IT systems to be more agile.
	This innovative model of acquiring IT related services has made organizations
	revisit their infrastructure and platform services strategy and optimize
	their IT spending while improving overall agility. This paper compares
	global IT outsourcing with Cloud computing along with the evolution
	of traditional IT services. Findings: The impact of Cloud computing
	on IT outsourcing is no doubt significant. Cloud computing represents
	a fundamental shift in how organizations pay for and access IT services.
	It has created new opportunities for IT services providers and the
	outsourcing vendors will have to modify their strategy to take advantage
	of this new computing paradigm. Practical implications: This research
	is relevant for practitioners as well as researchers in the field
	of IT outsourcing and Cloud computing. Originality/value: This research
	compares global outsourcing with Cloud computing along with the evolution
	of IT services. Very little research has been done in this nascent
	and important area. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	extended it by adding transformation features that allow mapping

  abstract = {From the March/Micra released in 2002 to the LEAF EV today, on-board
	electronic systems have come to possess bigger software programs
	and more complexity in the transition to distributed high-speed ECU
	network systems. Meanwhile, faster time-to-market requirements have
	shortened the development period. If a conventional development process
	like the waterfall model is applied to develop a distributed ECU
	network system, numerous problems may occur at the vehicle testing
	stage that requires a lot of rework. To avoid that, we devised a
	new development methodology of distributed ECU systems and implemented
	it in our vehicle function development programs to improve development
	work quality across the entire spectrum of vehicle electronics. This
	development methodology consists of two principal elements. One is
	an Electronic Integration Platform (EIPF) and the other one is a
	Design-EIPF (D-EIPF). EIPF is a system-testing environment for actual
	vehicle parts and D-EIPF is a system evaluation environment for virtual
	vehicle parts. Both of them are based on Computer-Aided Engineering
	(CAE) and use Model Based Development (MBD) simulation technologies.
	First, in the design phase, we create simulation models from the
	control specifications using Statemate and/or Simulink/Stateflow
	and run simulations to check the behavior of individual ECUs alone.
	Second, we create the D-EIPF environment composed of the ECU models
	and communication network models. The latter models run on CANoe
	using multiplex communication and an in-house tool for the harness
	connections. D-EIPF enables system-level testing as well as customer
	aspect testing at an early phase before EIPF tests and in-vehicle
	testing using actual parts. This means that we can validate system-level
	functions before building any bench test system or prototype vehicle.
	In addition, D-EIPF and EIPF use a common test suite that can run
	the same test scenarios between them, which improves traceability
	and development work efficiency. This paper gives a general description
	of the life cycle process using the EIPF and D-EIPF system, which
	is a symmetrical process for obtaining strong solutions. © 2012 SAE

	machines where probabilities can be associated with transitions and
	rewards (costs) can be associated with states and transitions. Through
	probabilities we model assumptions on the behavior of environment
	in which an application is embedded. Rewards can instead model the
	cost assumptions involved in the system's operations. A system is
	designed to satisfy the requirements, under the given assumptions.
	Design-time assumptions, however, can turn out to be invalid at runtime,
	and therefore it is necessary to verify whether changes may lead
	to requirements violations. If they do, it is necessary to adapt
	the behavior in a self-healing manner to continue to satisfy the
	requirements. We have previously presented an approach to support
	efficient runtime probabilistic model checking of DTMCs for properties
	expressed in PCTL. In this paper we extend the approach to D-MRMs

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to introduce software security for online
	games at two levels: first at the programming level and second at
	the web service level. Increasingly game developers are providing
	their games online, employing web services; however, security threats
	evolve with the use of web services in such applications which is
	a great challenge for game developers. The roadblock to providing
	secure game applications is the lack of understanding of secure coding
	concepts by game programmers. In this paper we propose the 5W1H re-documentation
	technique and the use of the Scrum agile software development methodology
	in a reengineering process to educate game programmers concerning
	secure coding concepts. The authors first prove how insecure coding
	can affect the gaming industry by introducing an example of an insecure
	game login application. Then the same login application is re-documented
	and reengineered with secure coding concepts. The reengineered application
	is then tested for security threats.},

	has used the Rational Unified process (RUP9) in its development.
	RUP is an iterative software development process framework. After
	analysing (use cases) and designing (UML10) any of GCS subsystems,
	an initial component description of its interface is obtained and
	from that information a component specification is written. In order
	to improve the code productivity, GCS has adopted the code generation
	to transform this component specification into the skeleton of component
	classes based on a software framework, called Device Component Framework.
	Using the GCS development tools, based on javadoc and gcc, in only
	one step, the component is generated, compiled and deployed to be
	tested for the first time through our GUI inspector. The main advantages
	of this approach are the following: It reduces the learning curve
	of new developers and the development error rate, allows a systematic
	use of design patterns in the development and software reuse, speeds
	up the deliverables of the software product and massively increase
	the timescale, design consistency and design quality, and eliminates

	by isostatic rebound have isolated numerous replicate populations
	of coastal cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii clarkii) in short
	coastal streams. These replicate isolated populations offer an unusual
	opportunity to examine factors associated with the maintenance of
	genetic diversity. We used eight microsatellites to examine genetic
	variation within and differentiation among 12 population pairs sampled
	from above and below these natural migration barriers. Geological
	evidence indicated that the above-barrier populations have been isolated
	for 8,000-12,500 years. Genetic differentiation among below-barrier
	populations (F ST = 0.10, 95% C. I. 0.08-0.12) was similar to a previous
	study of more southern populations of this species. Above-barrier
	populations were highly differentiated from adjacent below-barrier
	populations (mean pairwise F ST = 0.28; SD 0.18) and multiple lines
	of evidence were consistent with asymmetric downstream gene flow
	that varied among streams. Each above-barrier population had reduced
	within-population genetic variation when compared to the adjacent
	below-barrier population. Within-population genetic diversity was
	significantly correlated with the amount of available habitat in
	above-barrier sites. Increased genetic differentiation of above-barrier
	populations with lower genetic diversity suggests that genetic drift
	has been the primary cause of genetic divergence. Long-term estimates
	of N e based on loss of heterozygosity over the time since isolation
	were large (3,170; range 1,077-7,606) and established an upper limit
	for N e if drift were the only evolutionary process responsible for
	loss of genetic diversity. However, it is likely that a combination
	of mutation, selection, and gene flow have also contributed to the
	genetic diversity of above-barrier populations. Contemporary above-barrier
	N e estimates were much smaller than long-term N e estimates, not
	correlated with within-population genetic diversity, and not consistent
	with the amount of genetic variation retained, given the approximate
	10,000-year period of isolation. The populations isolated by waterfalls
	in this study that occur in larger stream networks have retained
	substantial genetic variation, which suggests that the amount of
	habitat in headwater streams is an important consideration for maintaining

	What started as an ad hoc approach is becoming a common practice
	among developers. It enables the immediate detection of bugs introduced
	into a unit whenever code changes occur. Hence, unit tests provide
	a safety net of regression tests and validation tests which encourage
	developers to refactor existing code with greater confidence. One
	of the major corner stones of the agile development approach is unit
	testing. Agile methods require all software classes to have unit
	tests that can be executed by an automated unit-testing framework.
	However, not all software systems have unit tests. When changes to
	such software are needed, writing unit tests from scratch, which
	is hard and tedious, might not be cost effective. In this paper we
	propose a technique which automatically generates unit tests for
	software that does not have such tests. We have implemented GenUTest,
	a prototype tool which captures and logs interobject interactions
	occurring during the execution of Java programs, using the aspect-oriented
	language AspectJ. These interactions are used to generate JUnit tests.
	They also serve in generating mock aspects - mock object-like entities,
	which enable testing units in isolation. The generated JUnit tests
	and mock aspects are independent of the tool, and can be used by
	developers to perform unit tests on the software. Comprehensiveness
	of the unit tests depends on the software execution. We applied GenUTest
	to several open source projects such as NanoXML and JODE. We present
	the results, explain the limitations of the tool, and point out direction
	to future work to improve the code coverage provided by GenUTest

	hierarchical partitioning approach that operates on any arbitrary
	3-D shape described as a triangle mesh. It first extends the concept
	of basin districts to the case of curved spaces through a partitioning
	process on a valuation representing the main curvatures over a polyhedral
	support. A hierarchical construction of basin districts is obtained
	from a watershed transform. The speed of the front propagation on
	the polyhedral surface is controlled by the local characteristics
	of the surface geometry. As a prerequisite, a set of co-processing
	tools has been developed that operates directly on a triangulated
	domain. This includes classical signal processing tasks (e.g., re-sampling,
	filtering) on a polyhedral support performing a trade-off between
	accuracy and efficiency. The ability to provide an intrinsic shape
	partition from any triangular mesh is useful in a wide range of applications
	from accurate geometric modeling, and hierarchical shape dissection

  abstract = {Along with the advances in wide-area network technologies and computer
	hardware, the increasing availability of powerful computers and high
	speed networks are changing the high performance computing paradigm
	today. Recent related research has led to the emergence of a new
	paradigm known as grid computing. A major motivation of grid computing
	is to aggregate the power of widely distributed resources to provide
	services to users. Several unique characteristics of this paradigm
	make the development of grid software more challenging. In order
	to develop grid-aware applications, software engineering principles
	(e.g. software process, life-cycle model) for building conventional
	software must be adopted to cope with these challenges. Nowadays
	two kinds of software processes are frequently mentioned: heavyweight
	and lightweight. In this paper, we address the issues of comparing
	the two kinds of processes and selecting the better one for developing
	grid software. We choose to examine two well-known software processes:
	IEEE 1074 [6] and Extreme Programming [1], which respectively represents
	heavyweight process and lightweight process. They are first examined
	in detail and a comparison between them is conducted. Then we present
	a selection guide to choose the better methodology for a grid software
	project. Our analysis shows that lightweight software processes such
	as XP are more suitable for developing grid software. Copyright 2008

  abstract = {Freshwater systems are ideal for landscape genetics studies; they
	generally exhibit asymmetry in gene flow with populations arranged
	in a hierarchical, dendritic fashion. Such gene flow asymmetry has
	the potential to influence the distribution of genetic variation,
	with downstream populations typically exhibiting higher genetic diversity
	than headwater populations. Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) are
	widely distributed throughout temperate North America. We examined
	the relationship between landscape attributes, molecular genetic
	diversity and differentiation among lake trout populations inhabiting
	a hierarchically structured freshwater system in northern Labrador
	(the Kogaluk River drainage). Lake trout (N = 567) collected from
	ten lakes in this drainage were examined for polymorphism at 12 microsatellite
	loci. The lakes differed in connectivity, size, elevation and position
	within the Kogaluk catchment. We observed relatively high levels
	of population structure and little migration among lakes. Waterfalls
	were identified as a factor contributing to the observed differentiation.
	Although a preliminary analysis suggested an isolation-by-distance
	pattern, a subsequent decomposed pairwise regression analysis allowed
	the identification of outlier lakes. Removal of these outlier lakes
	and of one other headwater lake, isolated from the rest by several
	waterfalls, led to the disappearance of the isolation-by-distance
	pattern, suggesting very little or no migration among lakes despite
	migration being physically possible. Estimates of effective population
	size correlated with lake area but did not differ between headwater
	and downstream populations, nor was there a relationship with elevation,
	a result consistent with the evidence of very little to zero gene
	flow among lakes. Our study is the first to describe patterns of
	genetic diversity among lake trout populations inhabiting a spatially
	fragmented system in an ecologically pristine and sensitive area
	of northern Canada, the barren grounds of northern Labrador. © 2013

  abstract = {We present a high fidelity cognitive radio (CR) network emulation
	platform for wireless system tests, measure- ments, and validation.
	This versatile platform provides the configurable functionalities
	to control and repeat realistic physical channel effects in integrated
	space, air, and ground networks. We combine the advantages of scalable
	simulation environment with reliable hardware performance for high
	fidelity and repeatable evaluation of heterogeneous CR networks.
	This approach extends CR design only at device (software-defined-radio)
	or lower-level protocol (dynamic spectrum access) level to end-to-end
	cognitive networking, and facilitates low-cost deployment, development,
	and experimentation of new wireless network protocols and applications
	on frequency- agile programmable radios. Going beyond the channel
	emulator paradigm for point-to-point communications, we can support
	simultaneous transmissions by network-level emulation that allows
	realistic physical-layer inter- actions between diverse user classes,
	including secondary users, primary users, and adversarial jammers
	in CR networks. In particular, we can replay field tests in a lab
	environment with real radios perceiving and learning the dynamic
	environment thereby adapting for end-to-end goals over distributed
	spectrum coordination channels that replace the common control channel
	as a single point of failure. CR networks offer several dimensions
	of tunable actions including channel, power, rate, and route selection.
	The proposed network evaluation platform is fully programmable and
	can reliably evaluate the necessary cross-layer design solutions
	with configurable op- timization space by leveraging the hardware
	experiments to represent the realistic effects of physical channel,
	topology, mobility, and jamming on spectrum agility, situational
	awareness, and network resiliency. We also provide the flexibility
	to scale up the test environment by introducing virtual radios and
	establishing seamless signal-level interactions with real radios.
	This holistic wireless evaluation approach supports a large-scale,
	het- erogeneous, and dynamic CR network architecture and allows developing
	cross-layer network protocols under high fidelity, repeatable, and

  abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to explain how cloud computing - conducting
	business functions on shared, off-premises computing systems - introduces
	strategic options and business-control challenges for executives.
	For example, cloud computing offers ubiquitous access to applications
	for interacting with all parts of a firm's value chain and it connects
	an organization with the rich learning opportunities percolating
	in communities formed by the users of the service. Design/methodology/approach:
	The paper introduces a capabilities-comparison-matrix approach that
	executives can use to uncover, evaluate and rank opportunities for
	employing cloud computing to advance a challenger enterprise's growth
	strategy. Findings: For a firm hoping to grow, but with fewer resources
	than its rivals, cloud computing offers the potential to do more
	with less, thus benefiting an agile, strategic adopter of its rapidly
	evolving technology and service. Practical implications: Using cloud-based
	services, a challenger enterprise can identify, qualify, engage and
	manage a global network of capabilities to match the captive, in-house
	activities of a bigger, better-established competitor. Originality/value:
	The practical question for adopting any new technology is, ``What
	is the value of what can we do (with the technology) that we could
	not do before?{''} To clarify choices, a capabilities-comparison
	matrix helps decision makers focus on which business activities should
	go into the ``do{''} and ``don't{''} classifications. © Emerald Group

	user story details and maintaining the backlog for sprint planning

	will review the techniques we have used during agile projects to

	Capturing artifacts from other agile projects and documenting recommended

  abstract = {The paper proposes the combination of three traditional modelling
	methods (analytical, continuous and discrete-event), into a unique
	hybrid two-level modelling approach, to address software process
	simulation modelling issues. At the higher abstraction level, the
	process is modelled by a discrete-event queueing network, which represents
	the component activities, their interactions, and the exchanged artefacts.
	At the lower abstraction level, the analytical and continuous methods
	are used to describe the behaviour of the introduced activities.
	The hybrid approach is applied to a waterfall-based software process
	to study the effects of requirements instability on various process
	quality attributes, such as effort, delivery time, productivity,
	rework percentage and product quality. Simulation results show that
	the use of the model can provide both qualitative and quantitative
	suggestions on how to improve the software process or on how to satisfy
	specific organisational needs. Although, the model has been primarily
	designed to represent the behaviour of hypothetical projects, and
	to allow researchers to view the implications of their assumptions,
	it can be easily customised and extended to become a tool for analysing
	and predicting the behaviour of actual projects. © 2001 Elsevier

	interconnected economies, societies, and governments. Moreover, the
	proliferation of discrete markets, categories of product offerings,
	and individualized customer segments motivates business leaders to
	drastically simplify their organizations to become more agile in
	exploiting this complexity. Incremental changes are no longer sufficient
	to remain viable in volatile and uncertain environments. Internal
	business processes must undergo radical simplifications that reduce
	cycle time (a measure of responsiveness), cost per transaction (a
	measure of efficiency), and the number of hand-offs (a measure of
	how often work is transferred to another organization or business
	process). IBM defines radical simplification as realizing reductions
	in these measures of 50% or greater. To achieve these goals, IBM
	executives identified the need for a consistent, carefully matched
	set of best-practice methods, techniques, and leading-edge software
	tools, including scenario-based guidance to enable leaders to radically
	simplify their businesses. This paper describes the resulting IBM

  note = {cited By (since 1996) 2},
  abstract = {One of the problems associated with complex systems engineering is
	identifying the system knowledge relevant to build system implementation.
	System operations are an essential part of this knowledge. Software
	and system engineering standards highlight the importance of system
	operations; templates for a concept of operations document are available
	from different standard bodies in the context of requirements engineering
	and specification. However, specific guidelines for operations modeling
	are not usually provided. This paper introduces an approach to systematically
	model system operations. The cornerstone for this is an operations
	metamodel; this metamodel is presented within this paper and has
	been defined using UML 2.x. The baseline for the metamodel is a schema,
	also introduced within the paper, which formalizes system operations
	in terms of commands acting on systems, inputs to the system, and
	different kinds of outputs classified into responses, notifications
	and alarms. Operations models, as presented here, comprise system
	knowledge essentials from a functional point of view but reduced
	in size compared to the whole system specification. They can be deployed
	in several ways; this paper presents their use as drivers for system
	development and validation from early lifecycle stages. ©2007 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Agile software development (ASD) is currently an emerging
	approach in software engineering for improving quality, initially
	advocated by a group of 17 software professionals who practice a
	set of ``lightweight{''} methods, and share a common set of values
	of software development. Owing to the attractive claims of successes
	of the ASD approach, many traditional projects, which used to practice
	plan-driven software development, are gradually transitioning into
	ASD-based development. This paper seeks to report the results from
	a survey-based ex-post-facto study aimed at determining the relative
	importance, if any, of the changes traditional plan-driven software
	development projects have to undergo to adopt ASD practices. Design/methodology/approach:
	The study was conducted using a web-based survey with ASD practitioners
	who had experience of practicing plan-driven software development
	in the past. ASD practitioners from a wide range of industrial sectors
	participated in the study. Similarly, the study is not restricted
	to any specific organisation/project size, culture, or nationality
	- the respondents were widely geographically distributed across continents.
	Findings: The study received 241 responses, of which 165 were usable.
	The study did not reveal any substantial difference in importance
	of the four classes of changes hypothesised - changes in culture,
	changes in management style, changes in knowledge management strategy
	and changes in development processes. The authors believe that this
	is an important finding because it is indicative of not isolating
	one class of changes from another in practical transition exercises.
	However, another noteworthy observation was that transitioning from
	heavily process-centric to short, iterative, test-driven, and people-centric
	development was considered by the largest percentage (roughly 77
	per cent) of respondents to be very important. The open-ended questions
	in the study also revealed three additional classes of changes: changes
	in personal characteristics, changes in customer attitude, and changes
	in knowledge and education of stakeholders. Originality/value: In
	this work an attempt was made to gain an understanding of the relative
	importance of the different critical changes that would be helpful
	to a project manager who is involved in the transition from traditional
	plan-driven software development practices to agile software development
	practices. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	At each site we determined benthic macroinvertebrate size, taxonomic
	and functional structure in addition to trout gut contents. In the
	presence of trout, we observed significant shifts in invertebrate
	body size towards smaller individuals, thus a decrease in total macroinvertebrate
	biomass was observed. We found that large taxa (Klapopteryx kuscheli,
	Tipula sp.) and active swimming species (Metamonius anceps and Hyalella
	curvispina) were reduced in abundance or were absent in reaches with
	trout. At the same time, we found that trout positively selected
	large size classes of invertebrates. As a consequence of species
	losses, benthic community structure changed drastically in the presence
	of trout: shredders were the feeding group most affected negatively
	(-68 %) followed by scrapers. The reduction of shredders may suggest
	a potential effect on Nothofagus leaf litter breakdown and hence,
	supply of FPOM to downstream reaches. © 2007 E. Schweizerbart'sche

	be able to utilize TDD more effectively. We conducted a controlled

	(``negative{''}tests) resulting in a non-detection of bugs. Students
	did show preference towards TDD in surveys. Although further research
	is required to fully establish this, we believe that identifying

	In this project, the project team applied the principles of agile
	development in the process of SPL reengineering. The key practices
	of the project include value-based increment definition, domain-driven
	responsibility alignment, iterative component refactoring and integration.
	We analyze the reengineering process of a major component qualitatively

	trend of investment, returns on investment and quality improvement.
	Our case study shows that incremental and iterative approach with

  journal = {IIMB Management Review},
  year = {2013},
  note = {cited By (since 1996)0; Article in Press},
  abstract = {Past research on the effect of ERP systems on agility is contradictory,
	and research on the post implementation effects of ERP systems on
	agility is limited. Employing a cross sectional field study, this
	exploratory study analyses how key defining features of enterprise
	systems environment - integration, process optimization, and best
	practices - affect agility. Standardization of processes has mixed
	effect on agility and depends on the extent of standardization implemented
	and whether it included prior simplification. Rather than the ERP-system
	enabled environment, the inadequacies in implementation and poor
	process optimization prior to ERP implementation are restricting
	process agility. Extended summary: Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
	systems flexibly support many changes that take place during firms'
	business growth & market down turn and enable fast paced changes.
	As a key component of current IT infrastructure in a majority of
	orrganizations today, ERPs though have delivered cost efficiencies,
	control and consistent execution, their role as claimed by the software
	vendors in enabling agility and innovation is ambiguous with some
	considering it an enabler while others view as impediment. In order
	to position themselves better to respond to market dynamics and changing
	business conditions, firms must have the agility - the ability to
	adapt by quickly changing and reconfiguring the necessary business
	processes. With limited research on ERP post-implementation effects
	in general and on agility and innovation in particular, this study
	employs a cross-sectional field study and analyses how key defining
	features of Enterprise Systems' environment - integration, process
	optimization and best practices affect firm agility in general and
	business process agility in particular. According to study, integration
	and standardization, the key characteristics of ERP-enabled environment
	have mixed and varying effects on business process agility and that
	is dependent upon the extent and type of standardization and integration
	implemented in the organization. Integration across hierarchical
	levels has helped process become more agile through improved visibility
	and decision making, while integration of processes and information
	across functional boundaries has contributed to improvements in the
	speed of execution and ability to reconfigure process components.
	Tight coupling of systems, structures and processes resulting from
	ERP implementation restricts a firm's ability to reconfigure and
	deploy business processes. Study suggests that it is not after all
	necessary for all processes to be agile. The study raises the importance
	of business process management capability of an organization and
	the best practice in building and improving process agility. Rather
	than the ERP-system enabled environment, the inadequacies in implementation
	and poor process optimization prior to ERP implementation are restricting

	paper is to illustrate the reasons for tailoring Agile practices
	within the context of large enterprises. The findings show that scrum
	roles and practices did not conflict with enterprise policies or
	processes and were thought to improve product quality and productivity.
	However, agile practices from the XP tradition were not so widely
	adopted. Test driven development did not integrate well within enterprises
	where independent quality assurance teams were constituted as separate
	departments. Continuous integration was found to be challenging where
	enterprise software products required time consuming regression testing
	and elaborate code release processes. While adoption of coding standards
	and collective code ownership are necessary to facilitate interaction
	between disparate stakeholder groups.},

  note = {cited By (since 1996) 1},
  abstract = {In this paper, we focus on challenges of supporting a decision support
	system (DSS) based on a hybrid approach (i.e. a federation system
	with data placement) for agile business intelligence applications.
	A DSS needs to be designed to handle a workload of potentially complex
	queries for important decision-making processes. The response time
	requirement (and a realistic goal) for such a DSS is near real time.The
	users of a DSS care about not only the response time but also the
	time stamp of the business operation report since both of them introduce
	uncertainty and risks to business decision-making. In our proposed
	DSS, each report is assigned with a business value; denoting its
	importance to business decision-making. An Information Value (IV)
	is a business value of a report discounted by time to reflex the
	uncertainty and risks associated with the computational latency and
	synchronization latency. We propose a novel Information Value-driven
	Query Processing (IVQP) framework specific for near real time DSS
	applications. The framework enables dynamic query plan selection
	by taking into account of information value and adaptation for online-arrival
	ad hoc queries. The framework works with single query as well as
	a workload of queries. The experimental results based on synthetic
	data and TPC-H show the effectiveness of our approach in achieving
	optimal information values for the workloads. © 2009 IEEE.},

  note = {cited By (since 1996) 2},
  abstract = {Agile software development is gaining popularity in industry. Anecdotal
	evidence to support this includes the emergence of agile practitioner
	journals and increasing attendance at agile-focused conferences.
	Many organizations are using agile methods because previously used
	techniques were not effective. Pair programming is probably the best
	known agile practice. Although controversial in both industry and
	academe, its use in education has been increasing, particularly in
	CS1. While some instructors fear that students may get a 'free ride'
	when pairing, empirical evidence shows that this is not the case.
	CS1 students who pair do as well in CS2 as students who worked by
	themselves in CS1, even when working alone in CS2 [1]. Pairing in
	CS1 leads to greater retention in the CS major, and also shows promise
	at reducing the gender gap in computing - the increase in retention
	among paired students is greater for women than it is for men [2].
	The members of this panel argue that many other agile techniques
	can be used effectively in the CS curriculum. Collectively, we have
	more than 60 years of industrial experience; we feel that this gives
	us a clear understanding of the realities faced by students as they
	enter the workforce. Because of this, we strongly believe that students
	should be extensively exposed to agile practices. We have successfully
	taught agile techniques in courses ranging from introductory programming
	to the senior capstone. The benefits of this include increased student
	confidence and successful project delivery. We believe that agile

	of genetic diversity based on key environmental features. Yet, the
	degree to which inferences based on single species can be extended
	to whole communities is not fully understood. We used a pristine
	and spatially structured community of three landlocked salmonids
	(Salvelinus fontinalis, Salmo salar, and Salvelinus alpinus) from
	Gros Morne National Park (Newfoundland, Canada) to test several predictions
	on the interacting effects of landscape and life history variation
	on genetic diversity, neutral divergence, and gene flow (m, migration
	rate). Landscape factors consistently influenced multispecies genetic
	patterns: (i) waterfalls created strong dichotomies in genetic diversity
	and divergence between populations above and below them in all three
	salmonids; (ii) contemporary m decreased with waterway distance in
	all three species, while neutral genetic divergence (θ) increased
	with waterway distance, albeit in only two taxa; (iii) river flow
	generally produced downstream-biased m between populations when waterfalls
	separated these, but not otherwise. In contrast, we expected differential
	life history to result in a hierarchy of neutral divergence (S. salar
	> S. fontinalis > S. alpinus) based on disparities in dispersal abilities
	and population size from previous mark-recapture studies. Such hierarchy
	additionally matched varying degrees of spatial genetic structure
	among species revealed through individual-based analyses. We conclude
	that, whereas key landscape attributes hold power to predict multispecies
	genetic patterns in equivalent communities, they are likely to interact
	with species-specific life history attributes such as dispersal,
	demography, and ecology, which will in turn affect holistic conservation

  abstract = {In global software development (GSD) projects, distributed teams collaborate
	to deliver high-quality software. Project managers need to control
	these development projects, which increasingly adopt agile practices.
	However, in a distributed project a major challenge is to keep all
	team members aware of recent changes of requirements and project
	status without providing too little or too much information for each
	role. In this paper we introduce a framework to define notification
	for development team members that allows a) measurement of notification
	effectiveness, efficiency, and cost; b) formalizing key communication
	in an agile environment; and c) providing a method and a tool to
	implement communication support. We illustrate, with an example scenario
	from an industry background, the concept and report results from
	an initial empirical evaluation. From the evaluation it follows that
	the concept allows determining and increasing the effectiveness and
	efficiency of key communication in a global software development
	project in a sufficiently formal way without compromising the use
	of agile practices. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	In the common practice, technological aspects, which are related

	often place constraints on the logical ones. Consequently, the flexibility
	that could be attained during design is reduced and, further, an
	actual implementation where both aspects are deeply intermixed is
	usually obtained. The aim of the research presented in this paper
	is twofold. On the one hand, an expressive and flexible language
	based on object-oriented high-level nets is proposed so that designers
	can naturally represent concurrency and synchronization. On the other
	hand, a powerful support toolset is provided so that design models
	based on nets can effectively be transformed into processes while

	redundancy but empirical evidence regarding introduction and adoption
	in software development is scant. A lack of knowledge redundancy
	is a limiting factor for collaboration, flexibility, and coordination
	within teams and within the organization. Objective: The scientific
	objective of this investigation was to explore benefits and challenges
	with improving knowledge redundancy among developers participating
	in job rotation. There were two practical objectives; (a) to establish
	customer support as a legitimate organizational function that would
	shield developers from support enquiries, and (b) to contribute to
	improved flexibility in project staffing by enabling overlapping
	product experience among developers. Method: We used action research
	to integrate organizational change with scientific inquiry. During
	a period of eighteen weeks, nine developers rotated to customer support.
	We collected data throughout the period of collaboration; in meetings,
	from comprehensive interviews, and from customer support work logs.
	Results: Perceptions of reduced efficiency and unnecessary redundancy
	outweighed benefits of shielding and learning about different products.
	Although there were strong indications of increased knowledge redundancy,
	the benefits were not sufficient to justify job rotation. Job rotation
	was abandoned after the trial period. Conclusions: Job rotation can
	contribute to improved knowledge redundancy. Benefits of knowledge
	redundancy include innovation stemming from integration of different
	knowledge domains and improved appreciation of organizational concerns.
	However, knowledge redundancy incurs a collective cost that must
	be amortized and legitimized by the organization. An adoption process
	that accommodates open and trustful discussion among all involved
	stakeholders is therefore encouraged. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

  abstract = {The U.S. National Science Foundation supported Consortium of Universities
	for the Advancement of Hydrologic Sciences (CUAHSI) Hydrologic Information
	System (HIS) project includes extensive development of data storage
	and delivery tools and standards including WaterML (a language for
	sharing hydrologic data sets via web services), and HIS Server (a
	software tool set for delivering WaterML from a server). These and
	other CUASHI HIS tools have been under development and deployment
	for several years and together present a relatively complete software
	``stack{''}, to support the consistent storage and delivery of hydrologic
	and other environmental observation data. This paper describes the
	development of a new HIS software tool called ``HIS Desktop{''} and
	the development of an online open source software development community
	to update and maintain the software. HIS Desktop was envisioned as
	a local (i.e. not server-based) client side software tool that ultimately
	will run on multiple operating systems and will provide a highly
	usable level of access to HIS Services. The software will provide
	several capabilities including data query, map-based visualization,
	data download, local data maintenance, editing, graphing, data export
	to selected model-specific data formats, linkage with integrated
	modeling systems such as OpenMI, and ultimately upload to the HIS
	server from the local desktop software. As the software is presently
	in the early stages of development, this paper focuses on design
	approach and paradigm and is presented to encourage participation
	in the open development community. Indeed, recognizing the value
	of community based code development as a means of ensuring end-user
	adoption, this project has adopted an ``iterative{''} or ``spiral{''}
	software development approach where 1) the general project requirements
	and hard boundary conditions are specified at the outset; 2) an initial
	brief functionality requirements list is developed; 3) the initial
	limited system is produced primarily by the core funded developer
	team, but with voluntary external programmer support as it becomes
	available; 4) testing and bug fixes by the developer team; 5) deployment
	of an installation package for end-users; 6) collection of bug notices
	and feature requests from end-users; 7) identification of specific
	bugs and features to be addressed in a new release; 8) addition of
	these features by the developer team, etc. This development approach
	is the most common approach used by open source projects because
	of its flexible and dynamic nature. This model is well suited to
	a community project where it is difficult (and often not useful)
	to fully-specify the functionality set required for a software release
	(i.e. as in the ``waterfall{''} development approach), but rather
	it is desirable to maintain an open structure that can easily be
	extended through the development of third party plug-ins to support
	as-yet unknown functions and capabilities, as well as a clear policy
	on how code is moved into the core system, and how external developers
	are included in the developer team.},

	a user-centered approach for building software for medical devices

	for software development projects. Increasingly, there appears to
	be a need to use high-ceremony `waterfall' type approaches at the
	programme and project management level, whereas at individual level,
	`agile' aspects of a process seem to help. A composite process framework
	has the potential for accepting this responsibility of balancing
	the modeling with software projects, as is argued in this paper.
	The development of software application systems, and management of
	the corresponding systems development life cycle is considered complex,
	time consuming and costly. This is so because, as argued by Unhelkar
	{[}5], the nature, type and size of software projects are different
	and so they result in differing requirements, development and implementation
	procedures.. Marks {[}3] indicates that the Waterfall model does
	not provide good project planning control and risk management. According
	to Marks {[}3], the iterative process has many strengths such as
	rapid feedback from users based on the actual system prototype, flexibility
	to address system evolving requirements, the rapid discovery of design
	flaws, and ease of deploying new functionality. An iterative project
	might run the risk of never ending process, due to its ability to
	react to continuous changes of business needs, and incomplete system
	documentation due to the fact that there is no scheduled period for
	documentation. The agile methods are suitable for projects with requirements
	that are rapidly changing and not very suitable for systems that
	have high criticality, reliability and safety requirements {[}2].
	Agile methods are evaluated based on project criticality, size and
	requirements. Boehm {[}1] Spiral life-cycle model that combines features
	of the prototyping and Waterfall model{[}4] is favored for large,
	expensive, and complicated projects. The following model as shown
	in (Figure 1). Shows that the Waterfall approach is best for project
	management as it gives the project manager full control over the
	project life-cycle. The iterative approach is the best during the
	analysis, design and implementation phases since it gives the project
	team more flexibility to address evolving system requirements and
	to iterate within these phases to ensure a comprehensive analysis
	and design has been done. The Agile approach is best during the implementation
	and testing phases since it helps produce incremental small software
	releases within a short iterative development cycles. The Composite
	approach will split the project into a set Of increments; each increment
	will consist of a set of the project life-cycle phases. For each
	increment, it will bring the best aspects of available software development
	processes (Waterfall, Iterative and Agile) together that can be used
	to develop and manage application software development.},

	The reason for choosing Scrum and XP is based on two facts. Firstly,
	CSE developers are not used to formal processes for software development
	and Scrum and XP are informal in nature, hence easier to adopt. Secondly
	CSE projects are often once-off and aimed at producing scientific
	results rather than commercial software, so the overhead of a process
	or methodology needs to be kept at a minimum. Scrum and XP are focused
	on producing software, thus keeping everything else, i.e. the overhead
	to a minimum, a fact that benefits CSE development. In this article,
	the characteristics of Scrum and XP in particular and agile development
	in general are evaluated against the needs of CSE developers. The
	results show that almost all the key points in both methodologies
	are well suited for CSE development and that agile development in
	general is a good match with CSE.},

  abstract = {Our civilization runs on software, and the role of software and more
	generally Information Technology (IT) is growing all the time. But
	complaints on software quality are getting more and more common.
	Software quality depends on many factors and sometimes also universities
	are blamed - they do not teach the essential skills, that Software
	Engineering (SE) education provides too theoretical or old-fashioned
	courses. Curriculum is a complex emerging system; here are analyzed
	factors which influence it. The main conclusion is that software
	is a process and its quality follows from the process quality. Process
	quality is reached by disciplined practices during the development.
	Traditionally, software development is based on the predefined path
	of development phases, which all have their purpose, base practices
	and outcomes. Opposite to this, there is a trend towards light process
	oriented software development culture - Agile development. In this
	approach, team work, active role of the client, and incremental product
	architecture is important. Software development is highly human oriented
	sector of industry. Productivity can not be increased - at least
	not dramatically - by tools and automation. New approaches in software
	industry are based on higher level of automation and reuse of available
	software assets. Large scale software development is based on reusable
	platforms, product families, artifacts developed by component factories,
	but finally especially in the intelligence of the professionals modifying
	and further developing the available artifacts. In spite of the improvement
	in automation in ``large scale{''} software development, the main
	part of software is still developed in very traditional way - from
	the scratch based on careful user requirements elicitation, specification,
	system design and implementation. SE curriculum should correspond
	to the industry needs, only then can universities produce highly
	skilled professionals, which can satisfy needs of software industry.
	Development of curricula is supported also by different standards,
	frameworks and recommendations developed by different interest groups,
	but the role of these ``global{''} curricula models in the development
	of high quality university curricula should not be over-estimated.
	Different approaches in SE curriculum development are introduced.
	The experiences of authors provide a path of tested ``good practices{''}

  abstract = {Software development projects are a complex undertaking. Aside from
	the technical aspects, numerous difficulties arise in their management.
	A one-size-fits-all, top-down methodology does not work, due to the
	nature of software projects and the people involved. In the last
	few years, there has been a trend away from command and control development
	processes toward people-centric processes such as Extreme Programming,
	Scrum, Crystal Clear, Feature-Driven Development. People-centric
	software development processes often fall under the term Agile Software
	Development. Despite the maturity of these processes as well as a
	significant number of publications and training describing them,
	organizations are not always well positioned to adopt the most effective
	agile software development processes due to the difficulty in creating
	a supportive organization. One way to understand the cultural and
	organizational orientations needed to support agile development processes
	is to view the organizational behavior with a metaphor. For example,
	the metaphor of software as a collaborative game has been widely
	used as one way to better understanding agile development. Organizational
	behavior styles are another way to gain understanding of organizational
	orientations. In organizational design, for example, there are two
	dominant orientations: the first orientation is bureaucratic, with
	strict hierarchy, authoritative power positions (e.g. command and
	control) and an emphasis on maintaining conformity with the status
	quo. The second orientation is the postindustrial, with decentralized
	and lateral structure, team-based and mission centered, with reciprocal
	power relations, emphasizing employee creative thinking and initiative.
	The postindustrial orientation, oriented toward people rather than
	structure, has a stronger affinity for the logic underlying agile
	software development and is difficult to apply. The question is,
	what organizational metaphor can be effectively applied to underlying
	organizational orientation needed to support agile software development
	process? To provide a tentative answer, scholars in organization
	theory and design have posited the jazz metaphor to theorize how
	we conceive the organizational dynamics inherent in the postindustrial
	organization. From the point for this article, it is argued the jazz
	metaphor better elucidates the supportive organizational culture
	required to effectively use an agile software development processes,
	specifically Scrum. The purpose of this article is to explore the
	jazz metaphor as it applies to a representative agile software development
	methodology, ultimately building a case that the metaphor can be
	used as a mechanism to better understand the organizational behavior
	required for self-emerging behavior often exhibited in teams using
	the representative agile development methodology. We will introduce
	and develop a linkage between organizational behavior in the context
	of a postindustrial orientation and the collaborative behaviors often
	exhibited in agile software development, using Scrum as a basis for
	the comparison; then explore the jazz metaphor as it relates to organizational
	behavior. Finally, we will explore the jazz improvisation metaphor

	and a third backlog for the design maintenance in the secondary site.
	Pull mindset, team working, team empowerment, and continuous improvement
	have become part of the everyday activities. Best practices from

	Also, the metrics have been reviewed. The major challenges have been
	related to the boundary rules, for instance, multi-site working,
	the platform dependency and the service level agreements but also
	to the roles and responsibilities. The Kanban boards and the chosen
	practices have been adjusted as the understanding of Lean has increased.
	This industry paper presents the journey to Lean product maintenance
	including the identification of the key success factors that are

	discussed followed by a deeper description of the implementation
	both in the CSR handling and in the Fault Handling (design maintenance)

	has been designed to support the process of capturing knowledge during

	conventional mouse and keyboard facilities. KBoard addresses these
	needs by (1) implementing the notion of workspaces that are built

	by group members; and (2) providing alternative dynamic QWERTY and
	pie-menu virtual keyboards that speed up text input. As per our preliminary
	evaluation of KBoard, this combination results in a powerful environment
	that facilitates knowledge capture and offers an appealing toolset
	to explore more fully the potential of large interactive displays

  abstract = {Agility is a must, in particular for business applications. Complex
	systems and processes must be continuously updated in order to meet
	the ever changing market conditions. Continuous Model Driven Engineering
	is based on our eXtreme Model-Driven Design (XMDD) framework, which
	has been designed to continuously involve the customer/application
	expert throughout the whole systems' life cycle including software
	maintenance and evolution. Conceptually it is based on the One Thing
	Approach (OTA), which combines the simplicity of the waterfall development
	paradigm with a maximum of agility. The key to OTA is to view the
	whole development process simply as a complex hierarchical and interactive
	decision process, where each stakeholder, including the application
	expert, is allowed to continuously place his/her decisions in term
	of constraints. Thus semantically, at any time, the state of the
	development or evolution process can simply be regarded as the current
	set of constraints, and each development or evolution step can be
	regarded simply as a transformation of this very constraint set.
	This approach, conceptually, allows one 1) to monitor globally and
	at any time the consistency of the development or evolution process
	simply via constraint checking, and 2) to impose a kind of decision
	hierarchy by mapping areas of competencies to roles of individuals,
	in order to identify required actions in case of constraint violation.
	The essence and power of this approach, which is technically supported
	by the jABC development and execution framework, will be illustrated
	along a number of real life application.},

	how to share knowledge among members of software development teams.
	In contrast to heavy-weight, document-centric approaches, agile approaches
	rely on face-to-face communication for knowledge transfer. Pure face-to-face
	communication is not feasible when applying agile processes in a
	virtual team setting. In this paper, we argue that the right approach
	for virtual software development teams using agile methods lies between
	a radical ``none but source code{''} standpoint, and the multitude
	of documents proposed by heavy-weight development standards. This
	paper introduces work on developing a system for the task-based capture
	and pro-active distribution of recurrent information needs that typically
	arise for developers, as well as potential ways to satisfy these
	information needs. Our approach facilitates an incremental organizational
	learning process to capture and maintain knowledge on what documentation/information
	is actually needed, such that documentation is created on an ``as

	treating the concepts of lean and agile in isolation or combination

	Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts an epistemological
	approach, using the complexity thinking as the dominant paradigm
	from which to investigate the concepts and principles of lean and
	agile. Findings: The epistemological approach to the topic clearly
	reveals the opposition between two thinking principles: the principle
	of simplicity and the principle of complexity. Next, the authors
	evaluated how the complexity thinking principles of Morin may permit
	the two different ways of thinking to be reconciled. They find out
	that, in an organization, lean and agile are not only inseparable
	but also interdependent. Practical implications: The paper shows
	how the concepts of lean and agile can be combined, which may be
	of help to managers and project leaders to adopt from both practices
	and tools to improve their competitiveness. Originality/value: The
	novelty of this paper is the presentation of an alternative approach
	to the concepts of lean and agile, using an epistemological point-of-view.
	The paper deepens the understanding of the lean and agile concepts
	by applying the complexity paradigm as proposed by Edgar Morin. Furthermore,
	it proposes self-organizing teams for possible unification of both

	system can be applied to software project management. It is a detailed
	investigation of the performance of a nine-person software development
	team employed by BBC Worldwide based in London. The data collected
	in 2009 involved direct observations of the development team, the
	kanban boards, the daily stand-up meetings, semistructured interviews
	with a wide variety of staff, and statistical analysis. The evidence
	shows that over the 12-month period, lead time to deliver software
	improved by 37%, consistency of delivery rose by 47%, and defects
	reported by customers fell 24%. The significance of this work is
	showing that the use of lean methods including visual management,
	team-based problem solving, smaller batch sizes, and statistical
	process control can improve software development. It also summarizes
	key differences between agile and lean approaches to software development.
	The conclusion is that the performance of the software development
	team was improved by adopting a lean approach. The faster delivery
	with a focus on creating the highest value to the customer also reduced
	both technical and market risks. The drawbacks are that it may not
	fit well with existing corporate standards.},

  abstract = {With the increasingly seamless integration of geospatial intelligence
	into mainstream IT solutions and the rise of the ``Geospatial Web{''},
	the need for geoinformatics standards is ever more critical. Geoinformatics
	standards detail the engineering aspects (and rules) capturing common
	agreements for implementing an interface or encoding that applies
	to specific geospatial interoperability problems. Standards from
	organizations such as ISO and the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)
	enable users to more freely exchange and apply geospatial information,
	applications and services across networks, platforms and products.
	This panel is about the emerging agile processes behind the development
	of such standards in the geoinformatics field, specifically complementing
	the traditional formal consensus processes as a way to keep up with
	rapid technology changes, and the immediate needs for these standards
	in a wide range of domains. Agile processes are based on iterative,
	incremental and collaborative development, and typically deliver
	increased value, higher adaptability and reduced risk levels in meeting
	customer requirements and project objectives. As an example in the
	geospatial field, the OGC Interoperability Program organizes and
	manages Interoperability Initiatives based on a rapid engineering
	process to develop, test, demonstrate, and promote the use of OGC
	standards. Such initiatives typically provide the initial working
	prototypes that are positioned to be the next best standards. Complemented
	by a solid architecture framework, this process allows for the development
	of set of standards for adoption in mature products. This panel hosts
	representatives from standards-development organizations and industry
	to provide their perspectives on the agile processes in geoinformatics
	standards development and their value to their members/customers
	in the era of ubiquitous geospatial informatics. Such agile processes
	contribute to achieving the guiding vision of a world in which everyone
	benefits from geographic information and services made available
	across any network, application, or platform.},

  year = {2006},
  note = {cited By (since 1996) 0},
  abstract = {Social loafing refers to the behaviour of individual members of a
	team who have tendency not to work as hard as they could or should,
	because social groups provide a degree of anonymity such that individual
	team members feel that their poor performance will be hidden by the
	overall output of the team. Agile Software Development philosophy
	espouses the importance of cohesive project teams, the empowerment
	of these teams, and the collective ownership of the code produced
	by the team - social values similar to those of communities of practice.
	This paper posits that one of the unintended consequences of Agile
	Software Development is that it may give rise to social loafing,
	under certain conditions. In order to test this proposition, research
	was carried out on two software development teams over an eight month
	period to determine if the values inherent in Agile Software Development
	could give rise to social loafing The theoretical assumption adopted
	by the authors was that the project team which fully adopted the
	agile approach would exhibit a greater tendency for social loafing,
	in comparison to the other team. The findings of the study indicate,
	however, that the opposite was the case; accordingly, the study's
	findings are interpreted to offer an explanation for this apparent
	paradox.},

	Utility Software-for computing the equation of state and the Rosseland

	T in the range 3.2 ≥ log(T) ≥ 4.5, and parameter R = ρ/(T/10 6 K)
	3 in the range-8 ≥ log(R) ≥ 1), and arbitrary chemical mixture. The

	almost 300 atomic and 500 molecular species. The gas opacities account
	for many continuum and discrete sources, including atomic opacities,
	molecular absorption bands, and collision-induced absorption. Several
	tests made on ÆSOPUS have proved that the new opacity tool is accurate
	in the results, flexible in the management of the input prescriptions,

	this work is to greatly expand the public availability of Rosseland

	a comprehensive taxonomy of the challenges faced when a medium-scale
	organization decided to adopt software platforms. The study also
	reveals how new trends in software engineering (i.e. agile methods,
	distributed development, and flat management structures) interplayed

	of eight different teams, three of which were working on three separate
	platforms. The collected data was analyzed using Grounded Theory.
	Results: The findings identify four classes of challenges, namely:
	business challenges, organizational challenges, technical challenges,
	and people challenges. The article explains how these findings can
	be used to help researchers and practitioners identify practical
	solutions and required tool support. Conclusion: The organization's
	decision to adopt a software platform strategy introduced a number

	in order to reap the benefits of reuse. Researchers need to further
	investigate issues such as supportive organizational structures for

  abstract = {Increasingly, information systems must be developed and implemented
	as a part of business change. This is a challenge for the IS project
	manager, since business change and information systems development
	usually are performed as separate processes. Thus, there is a need
	to understand and manage the relationship between these two kinds
	of processes. To understand the interaction between information systems
	development and planned organizational change we introduce the concept
	of process interaction. We draw on a longitudinal case study of an
	IS development project that used an iterative and incremental development
	approach. The concept of process interaction enabled us to understand
	critical events in the case, in particular those that were important
	for the mutual adaptation between the information system and the
	organization. We conclude that process interaction is needed to facilitate
	socio-technical innovation in a situation where the organizational
	change process and the IS development process are parallel but incongruent.
	We also argue that iterative software engineering frameworks are
	well structured to support process interaction. Finally, we advocate
	that the IS project manager needs to manage the trade-off between
	necessary process interaction and the internal IS project schedule.

	supply chains may benefit by adopting agile principles. A number
	of common supply chain problems experienced by manufacturers in the
	construction industry are outlined and a number of potential solutions
	are presented. While this research offers a detailed examination
	of specific supply chains, further work is required to produce results
	that can be more readily generalised. A number of areas are identified
	for further research. The lean manufacturing paradigm has been well
	explored in a construction context but little research has focused
	on how the principles of agile manufacturing can be applied. This

	MCAP n, a developer is teamed up with exactly one other developer
	to form a pair that works together for the entire duration of the
	project. In MCAP s, we allow a developer to pair with more than one
	other developer during the project. This ``pair-splitting{''} version
	of the problem facilitates knowledge dissemination among developers,
	but can increase the effort needed for a developer to adjust to the
	work habits of several partners. The difference between the commonality
	achieved with and without pair splitting crucially depends on the
	underlying structure of the problem. For trees, we show that the
	value of the maximum commonality is the same for both MCAP n and
	MCAP s. Additionally, we obtain polynomial-time algorithms for both
	of these variants. For general graphs, both problems MCAP n and MCAP
	s are shown to be strongly NP-complete. We prove that the maximum
	commonality for MCAP s is at most 3/2 times the maximum commonality
	of MCAP n. We also provide polynomial-time algorithms and approximation
	results for a number of special cases of these problems. © 2008 INFORMS.},

  abstract = {This white paper explains the benefits of the Model-Based Design (MBD)
	approach and Object-Oriented Technology (OOT) that DO-178C provides.
	It also specifically focuses on the usage of Models and COTS Qualifiable
	tools that automate or facilitate the verification and validation
	of avionics applications constructed from Models in order to ensure
	that there is no unintended function. Software running in Aircraft
	cockpits has dramatically increased in complexity since DO-178B's
	revision in 1992. Furthermore, over the past 20 years, software development
	methods have made significant leaps forward and DO-178B has begun
	to show its age with respect to the new technology introduced to
	facilitate software development. This year the newly revamped DO-178C
	standard sets the certification process record straight by embracing
	modern technology. DO-178C does not only solidify its foundation
	by clarifying its core document but also builds the infrastructure
	to support modern software development techniques already commonly
	used in avionics development for at least a decade. Fortunately,
	DO-178C upgrades and clarifies DO-178B. DO-178C therefore considers
	four techniques of contemporary software development practices which
	are published as supplements to the core document: 1Software Tool
	Qualification Considerations (TQC) [DO-330]2Model-Based Design and
	Verification Supplement (MBDV) [DO-331]3Object-Oriented Technology
	Supplement (OOT) [DO-332]4Formal Methods Supplement (FM) [DO-333]
	Organizations can see gains not only in the reduction of the development
	cycle but also in the overall improvement of the DO-178C certification
	process; including reduction of schedule and costs, and improvements
	in the quality and reliability. In the old school of thought, the
	methodology relies on textual specifications and physical prototypes.
	That is why the informal Text-Based Design approach is tightly associated
	with the waterfall methodology where all the textual requirements
	are manually coded, inspected, and tested on a real embedded system.
	In this method, changes in any part of the waterfall chain are very
	costly and time consuming, leaving almost no room to iterate on the
	design. By contrast, in the Model-Based Design approach, the specifications
	are self contained in the Human Machine Interface (HMI) Model. The
	HMI requirements are defined in an unambiguous way and often captured
	in a formal definition language. Model-Based Design offers a collaborative
	approach to avionics development and allows engineers to inexpensively
	experiment with various concepts by deferring hardware integration
	until much later in the development process. Correcting problems
	in the early modelling phase is undeniably the strongest argument
	in favor of the Model-Based Design approach for developing certifiable
	or non-certifiable avionics applications. This white paper is based
	on "MBD &amp; Code Generation: A Cost-Effective Way to Speed up HMI

  note = {cited By (since 1996) 0},
  abstract = {This paper presents the process of measuring the level of quality
	control process to ensure the quality of delivered software package
	during the development cycle. The success of the project requires
	three prerequisites and they constrain one another. Quality is the
	most important factor for successful project completion. In other
	words, quality should not be sacrificed for the sake of meeting cost
	budget or delivering within schedule. Also, cost caused by any quality
	issues such as defect resolution increases exponentially once the
	product is out of the door. Having said that, we also have to consider
	the schedule side of constraints for the successful project. In other
	words, we have no time to do a quality job and we have to compete
	with other competitors to ship the product to the market earlier
	than them. So, the quality measurement and management concept is
	introduced to meet the agile software development environment in
	conjunction with performance strategies to execute within organization.
	Obviously, there are many key performance indexes derivable from
	the actual data associated with quality control activities and it
	is desirable to create a quality process to integrally represent
	overall level of quality control activities performed while developing
	the software deliverables. With the quality process, it is possible
	to evaluate whether enough quality control activities are performed
	for the project officially and secure the quality of the software
	deliverables before it is delivered to the customers. © 2011 Song

	thus becomes the ultimate quality requirement from the organization's
	point of view. Quality models are used to support the management
	of quality. Such models describe the characteristics of products

	of controlling quality. The problem that organizations face when
	they become interested in improving and controlling the quality of
	their information systems is twofold: there are many quality models
	and measurement is considered difficult. We address this issue by
	linking a basic quality model with existing software metrics. We
	use a quality model, the SOLE model, which covers the interests of
	all the stake-holders in an organization. We show how to adapt the
	model to the specific needs of an organization, how to identify their
	special quality factors and break these down to the metrics level.
	The general input-process-output (IPO) method from system theory
	is applied in the construction process. We propose a do-it-yourself
	approach which offers organizations the flexibility to construct
	quality models to meet their own needs. The construction process
	is the emphasis of this paper, rather than a complete quality model.

  year = {2012},
  pages = {54-63},
  note = {cited By (since 1996)0},
  abstract = {The needs for rapid software release to the market are increasing.
	We notice the limitation for sequential software development like
	Waterfall, because it takes too much time to see the moving software
	and get feedback. We are thinking to transform and adopt iterative
	development like Agile. However, there are two major issues on iterative
	development. First, the process structure is not be defined, so that
	we can't verify if the software was made in the right way. Secondary,
	the software quality is evaluated in the acceptance testing by matching
	the user requirements, so that we can't confirm software quality
	from the objective viewpoint using metrics but only from the subjective
	one. These two issues are obstacles to transform to iterative development
	from traditional one. In this presentaion, we defined software development
	process and propose quality metrics evaluation scheme in iterative
	methodology. First, we categorize the iterative development into
	two types, pure-iterative and hybrid. Then, important four parameters,
	such as the sprint term, the release term, integration type and development
	type are detected to define the process structure. Typical metrics
	for sequential development can be used in iterative development.
	But, the metrics in the iteration process must be re-evaluated, because
	the code is not stable during the iteration process due to refactoring,
	requirement evolution and so on. So we proposed the metrics re-evaluation
	scheme. We also provide the example software's result that includes
	process structure, re-evaluated quality metrics, quality control
	chart and fault convergence. By the way, we still have a couple of
	concerns. Obtaining metrics causes the extra work for programmers,
	so it is trade-off of agility. Our assumption for fault convergence
	is seems to be justified in our example software, but, we have to
	collect more example and brush up our assumption. In the future,
	we have to examine more examples to justify the quality of software
	iteratively developed only by defining process structure, without
	obtaining metrics. © 2012 IEEE.},

	high dispersal in the latter as judged by the tagging data. Such
	heterogeneity apparently was a result of genetic drift in local demes,
	due to small population sizes and highly skewed paternity. The IBD
	pattern was interrupted by waterfalls, boosting FST above 0.30 between
	adjacent samples across these barriers. Overall, our results are
	helpful in understanding the interplay of evolutionary forces and

	for designing and integrating enterprise applications. This paper
	presents a methodology for migration of legacy applications and services

	and services to SOA, the methodology should be used in a consistent
	functional and technological manner. In addition, we have proposed
	a specific SOA migration approach based on multi-tier architecture.
	This architecture brings clear differentiation of logical and technical

	and agile manner. The architecture highlights position and role of
	legacy application, fine and coarse grained services with the respect
	to their role in the business process. As a critical component in
	the overall architecture, Enterprise Service Bus acts as mediation
	and virtualization layer helping to separate business and logical
	view of the process from its technological implementation and reduce
	dependencies. Our approach is based on analysis of the legacy software
	in order to identify the business and presentation logic components.
	The next step is to redesign the legacy code by isolating the business
	logic and performing code stripping. Finally coarse-grained and loosely

  abstract = {Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) are composed of frequency-agile radio
	devices that allow licensed (primary) and unlicensed (secondary)
	users to coexist, where secondary users opportunistically access
	channels without interfering with the operation ofprimary ones. From
	the perspective ofsecondary users, spectrum availability is a time
	varying network resource over which multi-hop end-to-end connections
	must be maintained. In this work, a theoretical outlook on the problem
	of routing secondary user flows in a CRN is provided. The investigation
	aims to characterize optimal sequences ofroutes over which a secondary
	flow is maintained. The optimality is defined according to a novel
	metric that considers the maintenance cost ofa route as channels
	and/or links must be switched due to the primary user activity. Different
	from the traditional notion of route stability, the proposed approach
	considers subsequent path selections, as well. The problem is formulated
	as an integer programming optimization model and shown to be of polynomial
	time complexity in case of full knowledge of primary user activity.
	Properties of the problem are also formally introduced and leveraged
	to design a heuristic algorithm to solve the minimum maintenance
	cost routing problem when information on primary user activity is
	not complete. Numerical results are presented to assess the optimality
	gap of the heuristic routing algorithm. ©2009 IEEE.},

	of technological change, and the highly competitive business environment
	are overwhelming software development methodologies that have stayed
	essentially the same for the last fifty years. Model Driven Architecture
	(MDA) is a current initiative by the Object Management Group that
	represents a major evolution in the way software is developed. There
	is growing consensus by the information systems community on the
	fundamental principals of MDA, but some critical elements are missing
	in the areas of transformation and system-behavior modeling. Agreement
	on standards and approaches in these areas will take some time, and
	substantial work remains before MDA can replace traditional, long-practiced
	methods and be considered a routine approach to software development.
	When this happens it has the potential to significantly improve the

	Traditional development methodologies and the newer agile methods
	strive to overcome quality and delivery problems by emphasizing customer
	involvement and by attempting to move system validation activities
	(e.g. those concerned with confirming that the system will meet the
	customer's needs) earlier in the development lifecycle. The adoption

  abstract = {Having competitive processes has become as important (if not more)
	as having competitive products. Simply designing good products is
	not enough to gain competitive edge. Business processes have grown
	complex and fragmented in an ad-hoc manner. They span several departments
	and are very inefficient. Often the work being performed conflicts
	with the organizations' goals and strategic objectives. Traditional
	practices and policies tend to encourage this, resulting in being
	part of the problem instead of being part of the solution. This paper
	presents a model driven methodology for Business Process Engineering
	(BPE) to support an organization's migration to effective, agile
	and efficient processes. The essential elements of the methodology
	are process modeling, process analysis, and process execution by
	utilizing an array of information technologies. The methodology steps
	depend on process models for understanding, analyzing, simulating,
	improving, innovating, and implementing the business processes. The
	methodology starts by defining the goals and objectives of the BPE
	project. Candidate business processes are identified. The selected
	strategic 'As-Is' business processes are analyzed to find where problems
	exist. Several techniques are employed to engineer the 'To-Be' process.
	The new process may be a radical departure from the old process.
	The alternatives are evaluated using cost/benefit analysis. The selected
	processes are then implemented using a phased approach that relies
	on information technology solutions along with the implementation
	of recommended organizational and cultural changes. A continuous
	improvement program is put into place to ensure long term success.},

	processes including chemical vapor deposition processes as well as
	etching processes, cluster tool configurations and wafer flow patterns
	tend to be more complicated. Frequent recipe changes require prompt
	adaptation of the scheduling logic to cope with changed configurations
	and wafer flow patterns. The scheduler should be responsive to occurrences
	of various events within the tool and should be able to coordinate
	and control complicated activities and tasks of the process modules

	a critical timing constraint that a wafer should leave the process
	module within a specified time limit after processing. Therefore,
	it is essential to have a systematic, flexible and agile method of
	developing a robust real-time scheduler. To do this, we propose a
	model-based approach based on finite state machines (FSMs) to develop
	a real-time scheduler for dual-armed cluster tools. We propose the
	scheduling decisions for normal operation. We then develop a scheduler
	model based on FSMs that specifies the scheduling decisions for normal

	interval for pairs. We then carry out a simulation study where we
	vary the shape of the learning curve, the length of the learning
	interval, the final productivity level of the pairs, the market pressure,
	and the size of the workforce. Our simulations show that the cost
	of the warmup phase is reasonably small compared to the project value,
	but nonetheless must be taken into account when estimating the project.
	Our results also suggest that the learning overhead is not an obstacle
	to introducing and using pair programming in a real environment.},

	The framework classifies existing approaches to process modelling

	the introduction of IT support in creative environments. In this
	paper we introduce case study findings along with the framework.
	The application of the framework is a first step to its evaluation

	which is different from the one for the presented data, they usually

	The paper adopts an investigative approach including literature review
	and vendor-provided information. Findings: Cloud computing is both
	a trend and technology to deliver software and hardware as a service,
	not as a product. It involves a centralized data center, virtual
	server space, and secure transfer of data over the internet. The
	alleged advantages of cloud computing include low cost to own (CTO),
	agile updates, openness, zero initial investment, just to name a
	few. Lately library system vendors have begun to deliver cloud computing
	options. For instance, Ex Libris will release Alma in early 2012.
	It is an Integrated Library System with a discovery layer based on
	cloud computing. Amazon (Elastic Compute Cloud called Amazon EC2)
	and other vendors also offer virtual servers for cloud computing
	and charge customers by hours, usage, and capacity. If this trend
	continues for the next several years, it is just a matter of time
	before librarians will face the decision as to whether they should
	move into compute cloud. Originality/value: The paper discusses this

	of thought. The trend towards agile development places the emphasis
	on constantly adapting to a project's changing goals rather than
	on detailed upfront planning. The majority of reports from practitioners
	of agile development are positive and confirm the advantages of this
	approach. However, moving from a plan driven culture to agile development
	is not easy. Making the transition requires changes to many established
	practices and may even touch core values held by stakeholders. Areas
	affected are requirements and change management, user involvement,
	willingness to take on responsibility, contract management, and the
	ability to live with many uncertainties. This paper looks at what
	it takes to make the transition and presents lessons learned from
	organizations and projects which have successfully completed the

	multi-tone radar systems that provide significant levels of information
	with respect to embedded indoor scattering environments is discussed.

  pages = {835-854},
  note = {cited By (since 1996) 0},
  abstract = {Requirements engineering (RE) practices are critical to success during
	the development of business software. As managers assess RE practices,
	they apply specific perspectives that determine problems identified
	and recommendations for improvement. Two perspectives have recently
	dominated managerial thinking within the software industry, one rooted
	in software process improvement and the other rooted in agile software
	development. Underpinning these perspectives are two theories about
	what constitutes good software practice. In this paper, we explicate
	these theories in relation to RE and show how they differ in basic
	assumptions about the nature of requirements, requirements capture,
	requirements usage, change management, and approach to improvement.
	The repeat-ability theory holds that good requirements practices
	are plan-driven and follow generic best practices to arrive at an
	agreed-upon baseline of software requirements. Response-ability holds
	that good requirements practices are adaptive and involve close interaction
	between customers and developers to arrive at satisfactory software
	solutions. We use case study data from a software firm, TelSoft,
	to show how the theories lead to different interpretations about
	why current practices are problematic and how problems are resolved.
	Relating to the improvement strategy adopted at TelSoft, we demonstrate
	the superiority, for managers, of negotiating response-ability and
	repeat-ability concerns when improving RE practices. The paper concludes
	with a discussion of implications for research and practice.},

  abstract = {We introduce the observe-mine-adopt (OMA) paradigm that assists organizations
	in making improvements to their software development processes without
	committing to and undertaking large-scale sweeping organizational
	process improvement. Specifically, the approach has been applied
	to improve software practices focused on maintainability. This novel
	approach is based on the theory that software teams naturally make
	observations about things that do or do not work well. Teams then
	mine their artifacts and their recollections of events to find the
	software products, processes, metrics, etc. that led to the observation.
	In the case of software maintainability, it is then necessary to
	perform some measurement to ensure that the methods result in improved
	maintainability. We introduce two maintainability measures, maintainability
	product and perceived maintainability, to address this need. Other
	maintainability measures that may be used in the mine step are also
	examined. Finally, if the mining activities lead to validated discoveries
	of processes, techniques or practices that improve the software product,
	they are formalized and adopted by the team. OMA has been studied
	experimentally using two project studies and a Web-based health care
	system which is maintained by a large industrial software organization.

  abstract = {Agile software development methods have attracted increasing interest
	in recent years. They hold out the promise of making software projects
	more effective by engaging more interactively with the system users
	and by reducing bureaucratic obstacles. Although users should benefit
	from systems more suited to their needs, agile methods make considerable
	demands on users during the development process. Thus agile development
	is often associated with the collocation of developers and users.
	This paper describes a study of a UK-based software development company
	which implemented a software project using the Scrum agile method
	in conjunction with a client based in Australia. The project required
	intensive, structured, communication by telephone conferences and
	email. This offered the opportunity for a researcher to observe the
	communication between the stakeholders as a silent listener at the
	telephone conferences and the recipient of copies of emails. The
	most immediate research question was whether it was possible to apply
	Scrum principles to a project where the client and user groups were
	split not just by oceans but by time zones where the duration of
	the shared working day was just one hour. This question fitted into
	a broader research agenda about the way variants of a core method
	may be created to deal with the demands of particular project contexts.
	As appropriate for a conference on research methods, this paper explains
	the research approach adopted and its practical results. It compares
	observation with other data collections methods, particularly interviewing.
	A key advantage of observation, particularly when the observer is
	a silent and invisible eavesdropper, was found to be that no demands
	were made on the hard-pressed project participants who were the subjects
	of the study. However, the approach had limitations such as the possibility
	of `deaf spots', that is, important communications taking place outside
	the hearing of the observer. With interviewing, the subjects are
	able to present explanations of their behaviour. While these may
	vary in reliability, they may be more accurate than the observer's
	unassisted interpretation of an episode.},

	- Web 2.0, open source design methods and usability testing were

	software development methods, coupled with usability testing, would
	enable the library community to take full advantage of the techniques
	and principles inherent in Web 2.0 open source software. Research
	limitations/implications - A major component of the evaluation of
	OJAX was a series of usability tests. As is the nature of most usability
	studies, the results are not generalisable. Originality/value - Aspects
	of agile software development methods, such as usability testing
	and iterative design, are recognised in the literature as contributing
	to the usability of library software. However, exploration of the
	use of a full agile framework plus usability testing to facilitate
	Web 2.0 open source software is rare in library-related literature.

  abstract = {Since VA Software adopted XP 2 1/2 years ago, the understanding of
	quality and the product quality itself have changed dramatically.
	Before we started with XP our code had alpha quality. Features were
	tolerably implemented, the UI was very bad and documentation was
	not even started. Today, the complete product (code, UI, documentation,
	SDKs) is constantly at pre-GA level. At any point in our development
	we can provide prereleases to our customers without any additional
	testing or release effort. Before we adopted XP it took us up to
	1 1/2 man years (6 QA engineers for 3 months) to bring a product
	release from development end to release. Our first XP release required
	6 man months (4 QA engineers for 6 weeks). Now we are down to 4.5
	man weeks (1 1/2 QA engineers for 3 weeks). For experienced XP practitioners
	it might seem strange that the quality did not immediately jump to
	the high level that we have today after adopting XP. This was caused
	by a scenario that seems to be very typical for companies that have
	an established waterfall based development process: the engineering
	team was enthusiastic about the new way of development, the product
	management team was indifferent and the QA team was highly skeptical
	of the promise of XP to generate an (almost) bug-free product without
	a long and manual testing effort after development was done. Nobody
	in the engineering or product management team had any experience
	with XP, so it was impossible to convince the QA team otherwise.
	(In fact, reports of bug-free code from other XP teams were more
	intimidating than inspiring). So, we started our XP process without
	full QA involvement and a full system test phase after development
	was done. This paper recounts the evolution of our development process.
	It shows all the phases that our process went through, major changes
	that we made and what the overall impact was.},

	that addresses both design and testing. This paper describes a controlled
	experiment that examines the effects of TDD on internal software
	design quality. The experiment was conducted with undergraduate students
	in a software engineering course. Students in three groups completed
	semester-long programming projects using either an iterative test-first
	(TDD), iterative test-last, or linear test-last approach. Results
	from this study indicate that TDD can be an effective software design
	approach improving both code-centric aspects such as object decomposition,
	test coverage, and external quality, and developer-centric aspects
	including productivity and confidence. In addition, iterative development
	approaches that include automated testing demonstrated benefits over
	a more traditional linear approach with manual tests. This study
	demonstrates the viability of teaching TDD with minimal effort in
	the context of a relatively traditional development approach. Potential
	dangers with TDD are identified regarding programmer motivation and
	discipline. Pedagogical implications and instructional techniques
	which may foster TDD adoption will also be referenced},

	in graduate courses is important for knowledge consolidation. However,
	one of the problems is that, usually, students are not prepared to
	manage and to be managed. This situation causes higher effort waste
	and is time-consuming. Additionally, the quality is decreased due
	to poor self-management and inadequate division of activities. Such
	problems can be minimized if there is a management policy that provides
	a wider vision of the project's course, allowing the problems to
	be anticipated in such a way as to correct the flaws as soon as possible.
	This work proposes the adaptation of the SCRUM Agile Project Management
	Methodology in the context of the development of academic projects,
	both in undergraduate and graduate courses, where students are organized
	in small teams and execute the project in a systematic way. This
	method was applied during the practical part of the Â¿real-time systemsÂ¿
	course, whose project was the development of an automated industrial
	production line with robot arms, using the LEGO NXT robotic kit.
	Therefore, this paper will show implementation aspects of the proposed

	it has to be tailored to the nature of each team and project in order

	a project employing the XP methodology, experiencing unique issues
	arising from the distinct project setup and team composition, as

	we aimed at applying ``pure XP{''}, but it became more and more obvious

	determines if XP can be applied successfully in the context of a

	project, we continuously evaluate different approaches of applying
	XP practices on short release basis. We have noticed that some practices
	can be adopted directly while others need to be tailored according
	to the unique environment. In this paper we reflect on our process
	based on the data collected through code analysis and process evaluation
	tools, as well as notes of process retrospective review meetings.

	flexibility are inconsistent and sometimes unclear, and empirical
	evidence is limited. This article makes an important distinction
	between flexible project planning and, flexible project specifications.
	A negative relationship is found between flexible project planning
	and innovation project performance, whereas flexible product specifications
	are found to contribute positively. This article also examines how
	technological turbulence contributes to the choice of flexible or
	inflexible strategies. Technological turbulence can be present in
	the external environment or can be internal to the firm, when radically
	new products are developed. The findings suggest that when businesses
	perceive technological turbulence in the environment they are more
	likely to adopt flexible approaches to innovation in an attempt to
	adapt to external pressures. In technologically innovative projects,
	product specifications are likely to remain fixed while. project
	organization is likely to be adapted to the needs of the project:
	Taken together, the findings suggest that innovation projects should
	maintain stable organization, schedules and budgets, but stay flexible
	about product specifications. Vigilance with regards to external
	and internal conditions of technological turbulence, which may lead
	organizations to be more flexible in terms of project planning, is

	result of a recent anthropogenic introduction from the anadromous
	population of O. mykiss below the falls. Furthermore, fish from this
	above-barrier population occasionally descend over the falls and
	have established a genetically differentiated below-barrier subpopulation
	at the base of the falls, which appears to remain reproductively
	isolated from their now-sympatric anadromous ancestors. These results

	to be anesthetized and adopted blood and tissue specimen. Then we
	observed the pathological change of pancreas and gut, scored it.
	We measured the blood value of diamine oxidase (DAO), amylase and
	tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). We detected content of malondialdehyde
	(MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) and activity
	of xanthine oxidase (XO) in gut mucosa. We detected the casepase-3
	activity and cell apopotosis by means of terminal deoxynucleotidyl
	transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) in gut mucosa,
	and conculated the apopotosis index (AI). Then using the PASW 18.
	0 software, we analyzed the data by anova and t-test, to make sure
	if the values were statistically different between the two groups
	and the mechanism of gut barrier dysfunction in panreatitis. Results:
	At 4 h and 8 h after operation, the SAP-group-mice had significantly
	higher pancreas pathological score (P < 0. 01), blood amylase value
	(P <0. 05), gut pathological score and blood DAO and TNF-α value
	(P < 0. 01), compared with the contral-group-mice. The gut mucosa
	MDA content and XO activity of mice in SAP group were significantly
	higher than which in control group (P < 0.01). The SAP-group-mice
	had significantly lower gut mucosa SOD content (P <0. 01) and GSH
	content (P <0. 05), compared with the contral-group-mice. The gut
	mucosa cells of mice in SAP group had significantly higher caspase-3
	activity and apoptosis index than which in control group (P <0. 01).
	Conclusions In severe acute pancreatitis, inflammatory factors such
	as TNF-awere waterfall-style released, induced gut mucosa suffer
	from ischemia-reperfusion injury, then serious oxidative stress developed
	in mucosa and activated caspase-3 pathway, inducing gut mucosa cells
	apoptose seriously, which was an important mechanism of gut barrier
	dysfunction.},

	Software Development continues to grow in popularity both among academics

	are not easy to replicate and the relative productivity of pair and

	expect that Agile's informal means of knowledge sharing breaks down
	as the number of project participants increases. Such issues may

	members on their perceptions of threats to productivity. The project
	was a large software development project consisting of 11 Scrum teams
	from three different subcontractors. The repertory grid sessions

	low priority, (3) Conflicts between organizational control and flexibility,

  abstract = {Cognitive Radio is an enabling agile technology for communication
	and channels sharing in multimedia and wireless networks. The authors
	consider multimedia traffic transmission over Cognitive Radio (CR)
	networks using a progressive source coding associated to fountain
	codes. For a Cognitive Radio infrastructure where the spectrum is
	owned by Primary Users (PUs) that have Binomial and/or Poissonian
	traffics, Secondary Users (SUs) are allowed to share these spectral
	resources using the Opportunistic Spectrum Sharing feature of the
	Cognitive Radio concept. The objective of this paper lies in characterizing
	the reliability and as a result evaluating the performance of the
	secondary multimedia service provision under both primary traffic
	types in lossy Cognitive Radio environments. The authors have conducted
	a general analysis for many still open issues in Cognitive Radio
	and tackle three critical factors responsible for secondary service
	disruption: primary traffic interruptions, concurrent access to shared
	frequency bands leading to collisions and subchannels characteristics.
	Numerical simulations, in view of the average Spectral Efficiency,
	examine the performance of the multimedia transmission under the
	primary interruptions caused by the Binomial and the Poissonian primary
	applications and consider also the dynamics between the competing
	secondary peers in addition to subchannels fading and noise. Copyright

	accounted for 58% of the genetic variance observed among the examined

	in shaping the phylogeographical structure of this species. Analyses
	of migration rates revealed that upstream dispersal was limited crossing
	waterfalls. Our study revealed substantial spatial and temporal variation

  abstract = {This paper presents a comparison between three classes of process
	models in management information systems (M I S) development. The
	activity-centred models are the most numerous. Based on the ``Waterfall{''}
	generic model, they include well-known process models defining the
	development process by finding and executing a plan of actions leading
	to the solution without mentioning a particular connection to the
	resulting product. A product is a specification of the solution to
	develop produced by an engineer. The product-oriented process models
	represent the development process through the evolution of the product.
	Their advantage is to put the product definition in the foreground
	and push the process definition in the background. But the process
	is defined as an organized set of transformation activities that
	do not allow the capturing of the semantic attached to them. The
	purpose of the more recent approach gathering process models is to
	emphasize the decisional aspect of the process. The successive transformations
	of the product are consequences of human decisions. Such models are
	semantically more powerful than previous ones because they explain
	not only how the process proceeds but also why transformations happen.
	Considering the limitations of the first two classes of process models,
	we think that the decision-oriented ones are the best adapted to
	describe the MIS process modelling. The paper shows an instanciation
	of the ``Nature{''} model to Object-Oriented Modelling and Design
	(OMT) methodology process.},

	improve patient safety and make health services more efficient. The
	UK's National Programme for IT has made great strides in achieving
	interoperability; through linkage to a national electronic spine.
	However, there has been criticism of the usability of the applications
	in the clinical environment. Method: Analysis of the procurement
	and assurance process to explore whether they predetermine usability.
	Results: Processes separate developers from users, and test products
	against theoretical assurance models of use rather than simulate
	or pilot in a clinical environment. The current process appears to
	be effective for back office systems and high risk applications,
	but too inflexible for developing applications for the clinical setting.
	Conclusions: For clinical applications agile techniques are more
	appropriate. Usability testing should become an integrated part of
	the contractual process and be introduced earlier in the development
	process. © 2010 European Federation for Medical Informatics. All

  abstract = {Manufacturers focus on becoming more agile, software firms deploy
	rapid application development tools - everyone is in a hurry. Although
	we all understand the benefits of being first to market, we understand
	just as clearly that not all first-to-market products enjoy the same,
	sustainable benefits from being market pioneers. Why do some pioneering
	products experience a more significant order-of-entry effect than
	others? Roger A. Kerin, Gurumurthy Kalyanaram, and Daniel J. Howard
	examine two factors - product hierarchy and brand strategy - which
	may influence the magnitude of this effect for new consumer packaged
	goods. First, they hypothesize that pioneering a new product class
	offers a greater advantage than introducing a new form to an existing
	product class. Second, they predict that the order-of-entry effect
	will be greater for brand extensions than for entirely new brands.
	Finally, considering both product hierarchy and brand strategy, they
	expect that the order-of-entry advantage for brand extensions over
	new brands will be significantly greater within new product classes
	than for new forms of existing products. These hypotheses are tested
	using data from the Information Resources, Inc. Behaviorscan® data
	set. Collected from 2,500 household panel members, 75 supermarkets,
	and 25 drugstores, this database contains weekly measures of brand
	trial penetration as well as brand distribution, price, and promotion
	information in eight geographic markets from the period 1983-1988.
	The models developed in this study explore the relationships among
	brand trial penetration, product hierarchy, brand strategy, order
	of entry, lag time between successive brand entrants, and marketing
	mix variables (i.e., price, promotion, distribution, and advertising).
	The study strongly supports all three hypotheses. In particular,
	the analysis clearly demonstrates that the order-of-entry effect
	is greatest for a new product class pioneered by a brand extension.
	Order of entry has the least effect on a new product form pioneered
	by an entirely new brand. For a company seeking a competitive advantage
	from being first to market, innovation in product function offers
	greater potential benefit than innovation in product form. Such a
	company can also benefit from building on the name and reputation
	of its established brands. Although the study finds these order-of-entry
	effects significant, the effects of marketing mix variables such
	as product price and promotion are consistently stronger.},

  abstract = {One of the primary objectives of deploying cognitive radio (CR) within

	rights of incumbent licensed (primary) transmissions are protected
	with respect to interference mitigation when unlicensed (secondary)
	communications are ssimultaneously operating within the same spectral
	vicinity. In this article, we present non-contiguous orthogonal frequency
	division multiplexing (NC-OFDM) as a promising and practical approach
	for achieving spectrally agile wireless data transmission that is
	suitable for secondary users (SUs) to access fragmented spectral
	opportunities more efficiently. Furthermore, a review of the current
	state-of-the-art is conducted with respect to methods specifically
	designed to protect the transmissions of the primary users (PUs)
	from possible interference caused by nearby SU transceivers employing
	NC-OFDM. These methods focus on the suppression of out-of-band (OOB)
	emissions resulting from the use of NC-OFDM transmission. To achieve
	the required OOB suppression, we present two practical approaches
	that can be employed in NC-OFDM, namely, the insertion of cancellation
	carriers and windowing. In addition to the theoretical development
	and proposed improvements of these approaches the computer simulation
	results of their performance are presented. Several real-world scenarios
	regarding the coexistence of both PU and SU signals are also studied
	using actual wireless experiments based on software-defined radio.
	These simulation and experimental results indicate that OOB suppression
	can be achieved under real-world conditions, making NC-OFDM transmission
	a viable option for CR usage in DSA networks.},

	approaches to the development of software systems that have features

	methods that are currently being used. Some backlogs, especially

	are developed repeatedly at each sprint period. Despite the known
	advantages of SCRUM, however, its backlogs focus only on functional

	This paper introduces the ACRUM that is a quality attribute driven
	agile development method. The main characteristic of the proposed
	solution is that it is derived from values and practices of SCRUM
	to be compatible with the SCRUM process and to keep its agility intact.
	The effect of ACRUM was evaluated through an agile process evaluation

	These new development techniques are expected to provide a solution

	cost of memory in recent years, it is now becoming possible to introduce
	these new techniques into the field of computer software development.
	Against this background, we applied a new development approach based
	on spiral modeling to the development of telecommunications software
	and compared it with the conventional development approach with respect
	to the productivity of software development, the qualify of software
	programs, and other factors. Although the man-hour control and some
	other technical problems were left unsolved in experimenting with
	this new development approach based on spiral modeling, we were able
	to obtain overall good results regarding productivity and the quality
	of software. © 1998 Scripta Technica.},

	companies and banks are under high pressure to innovate, improvise
	and differentiate their products and services while continuing to
	reduce the time-to market for new product introductions. Generating
	a single view of the customer is critical from different perspectives
	of the systems developer over a period of time because of the existence
	of disconnected systems within an enterprise. Therefore, to increase
	revenues and cost optimization, it is important build enterprise
	systems more closely with the business requirements by reusing the
	existing systems. While building distributed based applications,
	it is important to take into account the proven processes like Rational
	Unified Process (RUP) to mitigate the risks and increase the reliability
	of systems. Experiences in developing applications in Java Enterprise
	Edition (JEE) with customized RUP have been presented in this paper.
	RUP is adopted into an onsite-offshore development model along with
	ISO 9001 and SEI CMM Level 5 standards. This paper provides an RUP
	approach to achieve increased reliability with higher productivity
	and lower defect density along with competitiveness through cost
	effective custom software solutions. Early qualitative software reliability
	prediction is done using fuzzy expert systems, using which the expected
	number of defects in the software prior to the experimental testing
	is obtained. The predicted results are then compared with the practical

	software development methodologies. XP is defined as a consistent
	set of values and practices designed to work well together, but lacks
	practices for project management and especially for supporting the
	customer role. The customer representative is constantly under pressure
	and may experience difficulties in foreseeing the adequacy of a release
	plan. Objective: To assist release planning in XP by structuring
	the planning problem and providing an optimization model that suggests
	a suitable release plan. Method: We develop an optimization model
	that generates a release plan taking into account story size, business
	value, possible precedence relations, themes, and uncertainty in
	velocity prediction. The running-time feasibility is established
	through computational tests. In addition, we provide a practical
	heuristic approach to velocity estimation. Results: Computational
	tests show that problems with up to six themes and 50 stories can
	be solved exactly. An example provides insight into uncertainties
	affecting velocity, and indicates that the model can be applied in
	practice. Conclusion: An optimization model can be used in practice
	to enable the customer representative to take more informed decisions
	faster. This can help adopting XP in projects where plan-driven approaches
	have traditionally been used. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {A radio frequency interference (RFI) excision algorithm based on spectral
	kurtosis, a spectral variant of time-domain kurtosis, is proposed
	and implemented in software. The algorithm works by providing a robust
	estimator for Gaussian noise that, when violated, indicates the presence
	of non-Gaussian RFI. A theoretical formalism is used that unifies
	the well-known time-domain kurtosis estimator with past work related
	to spectral kurtosis, and leads naturally to a single expression
	encompassing both. The algorithm accumulates the first two powers
	of M power spectral density (PSD) estimates, obtained via Fourier
	transform, to form a spectral kurtosis (SK) estimator whose expected
	statistical variance is used to define an RFI detection threshold.
	The performance of the algorithm is theoretically evaluated for different
	time-domain RFI characteristics and signal-to-noise ratios eta. The
	theoretical performance of the algorithm for intermittent RFI ( RFI
	present in R out of M PSD estimates) is evaluated and shown to depend
	greatly on the duty cycle, d = R/M. The algorithm is most effective
	for d = 1/( 4 + eta), but cannot distinguish RFI from Gaussian noise
	at any eta when d = 0.5. The expected efficiency and robustness of
	the algorithm are tested using data from the newly designed FASR
	Subsystem Testbed radio interferometer operating at the Owens Valley
	Solar Array. The ability of the algorithm to discriminate RFI against
	the temporally and spectrally complex radio emission produced during
	solar radio bursts is demonstrated.},

	components from previous projects will also grow considerably. Remaining
	conversant with all components in such a repository presents a significant
	challenge to developers. Indeed the retrieval of a particular component
	in this large search space may prove problematic. Further to this,
	the reuse of components developed in an Agile environment is likely
	to be hampered by the existence of little or no support materials.
	We propose to infer the need for a component and proactively recommend
	that component to the developer using a technique which is consistent
	with the principles of Agile methodologies. Our RASCAL recommender
	agent tracks usage histories of a group of developers to recommend
	to an individual developer components that are expected to be needed
	by that developer. Unlike many traditional recommender systems, we
	may recommend items that the developer has actually employed previously.
	We introduce a content-based filtering technique for ordering the
	set of recommended software components and present a comparative
	analysis of applying this technique to a number of collaborative
	filtering algorithms. We also investigate the relationship between
	the number of usage histories collected and recommendation accuracy.
	Our overall results indicate that RASCAL is a very promising tool

  abstract = {One of the most expensive activities that occurs as software is developed
	and maintained is the testing (or retesting) of the software after
	it has been modified. Studies suggest that a significant portion
	of development and maintenance costs go to this retesting, which
	is known as regression testing. Reports estimate that regression
	testing consumes as much as 80% of the overall testing budget and
	can consume up to 50% of the cost of software maintenance. Rapidly
	changing software and computing environments present many challenges
	for effective and efficient regression testing in practice. Regression
	testing can be performed after changes are made to the software,
	such as after nightly or regular builds, before a new version of
	the software is released, every time the software is saved and compiled,
	such as in an agile development environment, or before patches, such
	as security patches, are released. Regardless of the environment
	or when it is performed, the goals of regression testing are the
	same: to improve confidence that the changes behave as intended and
	that they have not adversely affected unchanged parts of the software.
	Because regression testing is important, but expensive, much research
	has been performed, both in industry and in academia, to develop
	techniques to make regression testing more effective and efficient.
	This research has also produced many tools and systems that have
	been used for empirical studies that investigate the effectiveness,
	scalability, and practicality of the techniques. Researchers have
	developed techniques for addressing a number of issues related to
	regression testing, and, in this talk, I will discuss them in four
	areas. First, techniques attempt to reduce the regression testing
	time by creating effective regression test suites that test the changed
	part of the software, by identifying test cases in the regression
	test suite that do not need to be rerun on the changed software,
	and by identifying and removing obsolete test - cases. Second, techniques
	can reuse test suites created for one version of the software by
	identifying those test cases that need to be rerun for testing subsequent
	versions of the software and by computing an effective ordering for
	running the test cases. Third, techniques can recycle test cases
	by monitoring executions to gather test inputs that can be used for
	retest-ing and by creating unit test cases from system test cases.
	Finally, techniques could recover test cases by identifying, manipulating,
	and transforming obsolete test cases, by generating new test cases
	from old ones, and by repairing test cases when the software changes.
	In this talk, I will overview the research in testing of evolving
	software, and discuss achievements to date in managing regression
	testing by reducing, reusing, recycling, and recovering test cases.
	I will also present the state of the research and the state of the
	practice in regression testing. Finally, I will discuss the current
	trends in both academia and industry, the challenges for solving
	the difficult problems that exist, the promise for testing of evolving
	software in the future, and the important open challenges for regression
	testing in the next decade.},

	is a powerful technology that greatly improves programmer's ability
	to quickly introduce changes to a software system. AOP enables easily
	modifying behavior of numerous locations in the system code or adding
	new behavior. AOP is perceived by some people not to be mature enough;
	hence they avoid using it in production software. We have developed
	ACME, a prototype tool that implements a refactoring process for
	aspects. ACME enables a developer to convert AspectJ code to pure
	Java code according to conversion patterns. The available patterns
	are creating a singleton class from an aspect and merging aspects
	into existing classes. The tool creates modular and readable object-oriented
	code. This paper presents ACME functionality using example transformations

  abstract = {Reliability is a systematic work, and it must be embedded in the product
	development process to improve the inherent reliability, so a suitable
	reliability work flow is very important. Meanwhile, technical details
	are crucial to the achievement of reliability work, and multidisciplinary
	knowledge is generally used to direct or audit the design specifics.
	Therefore, the reliability work has two characteristics: systematic
	and technical. On the basis of the waterfall model of product development,
	a modified reliability work flow was introduced, which was established
	and embedded in the integrated product development model. In this
	work flow, we ensure the final achievement by controlling some key
	steps, such as the input of reliability requirement, system and sub-system
	level reliability design, key module and device reliability testing,
	evaluation and auditing, and etc. We guarantee the quality of every
	steps work by defining and regularizing the role responsibilities
	and work details, thus improve the overall output of reliability
	work. In order to enhance its operational characteristic, some work
	was modified or simplified according to the company situation. For
	example, we emphasize reliability requirements must have two key
	characteristics: quantitative and decomposable. After near two years
	implementation, the defects of new products reduced by 10%, and the
	customer satisfaction increased form 85% to 90%, which shows that
	this work flow is suitable to our company. It can be expected reasonably
	that the reliability work flow will be more effective and robust
	by further modification and standardization as time goes, and the

	However, like sentences whispered in a children's telephone game,
	as an issue moves through a software development process, it may
	undergo many changes, making it difficult to ensure that the problem
	reported was actually fixed. To better understand how software teams
	preserve the integrity of user-reported issues, we observed a software
	team over a 6-month period, analyzing the trajectory of user requests
	through their software development processes. Our observations revealed
	several representations of issues, highlighting several points where
	information about an issue was lost or transformed. Although this
	information loss appeared to be unavoidable as an issue went through
	the resolution process, we found it was offset by a web of transactive
	memory distributed throughout the support and product teams. This
	memory was reinforced by asynchronous chat about recent and commonly
	reported issues, and shared notions of what issues should be considered
	severe or urgent. © 2012 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Requirement management is the most important as well as most neglected
	area of Software Engineering and Project management. 80\% projects
	get fall due to poor requirement gathering and tracking follow ups.
	In Process models which are being followed in Software Development
	requirement gathering process is considered a task. Web development
	having fast iterations and quick releases mostly follows agile model.
	The pace and principles of agile development do not allow developers
	to maintain a proper set of requirement documentation. As per agile
	manifesto client and developers being in face to face communication
	minimizes the need of client requirement documentation. The focus
	is totally on the development and delivery to client in minimum time
	period. So documentation importance has not been realized in this
	scenario. But case is different in distributed agile based development,
	where development resources and client are globally at different
	locations without any direct and face to face communication. Thus
	there arises the need of maintaining minimum documentation related
	to client requirement and tracking to meet and fulfill the client
	requirements. Proper documentation helps developers to keep track
	of the client requirements so that they could not miss even a minor
	task. Therefore, light weight process needs to be introduced so that
	developers could follow the process of requirement gathering and
	tracking without putting extra time and effort during their fast
	paced development. A light weight process for requirement gathering
	and tracking in distributed agile development is proposed in this
	research. The process proposed requires minimum resources and very
	small documentation besides the actual development process. This
	process improves the client's satisfaction and performance of the
	developers. It also bridges the communication gap between client
	and developers.},

	including pattern called ``Software Requirement Modeling Pattern
	(RMP){''} in the RUP framework. The 4+1 software architecture used
	in RUP is extended to support Requirement Modeling Pattern. It is
	shown that, to include process pattern, RUP needs to be a Requirement
	Driven Approach. Requirement Modeling Pattern is applied in the RUP
	framework according to our definition of process pattern. Our aim
	is the extension of requirement types. In fact, a new requirement
	type called ``Software Process Requirement{''} is defined and some
	problems of the software development process domain are involved
	in it. There are three questions that must be addressed. First, ``How
	the behavior of requirements are represented?{''} second, ``In which
	repository the states of requirements are saved?{''} third, ``Which
	transformation exist from model elements to real requirements?{''}.
	We show that the proposed process pattern needs Requirement Driven
	Approach. In the proposed process pattern, UML is used as a specification,
	visualization, modeling, and documentation language. In Requirement
	Driven Approach (instead of Use Case Driven Approach in RUP), some
	relationships between requirement artifact classes are highlighted
	by a model. Rational Rose and Rational RequisitePro are used to manage
	the Artifact Life Cycle and control the requirements. To use the
	Requirement Driven Approach (RDA) we need a modified software architecture,
	and inclusion of a new view called ``Requirement View{''}. By using
	this view, we change the name of Software Architecture from (4+1)
	to (4R1), where R indicates the ``Requirements{''}. In summary, the
	4R1 Software Architecture is given which is a superset of the 4+1
	Software Architecture. A Requirement Model is associated to Requirement
	View, and the proposed process pattern is defined based on the new
	view.},

  abstract = {Requirement traceability matrix is a table that captures the complete
	user and system requirement for the system. It helps to trace from
	requirement till testing in order to verify that the requirement
	is fulfilled. In SCRUM development methodology, requirement traceability
	matrix is used to capture the linkage of user stories between product
	backlog and sprint backlog. The linkages between the requirements
	are retrieved through these two documents. However, unstructured
	format of both documents do not help in getting the requirement traceability.
	Thus, requirement traceability has become an issue for SCRUM practitioners
	especially for system development and maintenance. Therefore, this
	study will introduce structured format of available artifacts and
	develop a tracing tool to automatically generate the requirement
	traceability matrix by keyword searching. Both the documents used
	in this study have to be prepared by using the structured format
	and the proposed traceability tool is able to generate the requirement
	traceability matrix automatically by keyword searching functionality.
	The result shows that the introduced structured format is very useful
	and it has increase the efficiency of retrieving the matrix far better
	than previous process. There is a significant time saved up to 95%
	for generating the requirement traceability matrix using the proposed
	method and tool. As a conclusion, requirement traceability can be
	achieved in SCRUM methodology through the proposed structured documentation

	through their external interfaces. A component's behavior can be
	effectively described using finite state automata-based formalisms
	(e.g., statecharts [5]). The basic formalism, labelled transition
	systems, describes the behavior of a component in terms of states
	and labeled transitions. The more advanced formalisms, such as modal
	transition systems and interface automata, extend LTS to incorporate
	additional information related to interface operation controllability
	- distinguishing between input, output, and internal actions - and
	the possible partiality of a component's specification - distinguishing
	between required and unknown (maybe) behaviors. Capturing the controllability
	and partiality aspects of a component's specification facilitates
	(1) checking interface compatibility, (2) checking whether one component
	can safely replace another component, and (3) checking whether one
	specification is a proper refinement of another specification. In
	this paper, we study the existing definitions of these three types
	of checks, and then exemplify their limitations in the context of
	modal interface automata (MIA); MIA is a class of component behavior
	specifications that incorporates both controllability and partiality
	information. We outline a set of enhancements to MIA as possible

  abstract = {Knowledge-based systems have often been criticized for the limited
	theoretical base on which they are constructed. The partially valid
	view, held by many, is that systems are often constructed in an ad
	hoc, individual way, which leads to unmaintainable, unreliable, and
	unrigorous systems. This holds even though there have been several
	attempts at producing development methodologies to assist the knowledge
	engineer in the construction process1-7. A large contributing reason
	for the limited applicability of these methodologies is that they
	often too closely follow the waterfall model approach used for the
	development of conventional software systems8. This approach forces
	developers to make large jumps in the system state during development,
	which is not necessarily the most conductive way to model the domain
	accurately. The paper therefore aims to introduce a new alternative
	approach that shows the benefits of taking a software engineering
	philosophy towards the development of knowledge-based systems. The
	methodology breaks down the process of creating a knowledge-based
	system into constituent parts and discusses ways of creating rigorous
	specifications for those parts, as applicable. This includes specifying
	the knowledge base, the representation, the control architecture,
	etc., thus promoting quality systems that are better specified, more

	is introduced that supports providers in ANs to decide on the establishment
	of a combination of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) that incurs the
	lowest risk of SLA violation. Finally, a benchmark for risk-based
	decisions is derived that serves to evaluate the efficiency of the
	choice. The impact of the available amount of monitoring data on

	by Northern blot analysis of total RNA. The abundance of OTC mRNA
	was lowest at calving and was decreased by RPC and 6.2% RUP feeding.
	Feeding 6.2% RUP did not alter AS, PC, or PEPCK mRNA. The expression
	of AS mRNA increased and PEPCK mRNA tended to increase from calving
	to 56 DIM. Pyruvate carboxylase mRNA increased more than twofold
	at calving. The data indicated adaptation to lactation for gluconeogenic

	in mRNA for urea cycle enzymes. Feeding additional protein, as RUP,
	failed to induce mRNA for key enzymes in gluconeogenesis or ureagenesis.},

	makes it possible to transform requirements directly into design-level

	By embracing agile principles and utilizing agile concepts, such
	as a cross functional team, a team collaboration approach with frequent
	reviews to inspect and adapt as needed, etc, the business was able
	to reap immediate benefits. It was a challenging journey for the
	team, where the mix of onshore-offshore support engineers and an
	integrated client-vendor relationship within an agile team and focused
	framework helped to transform the support organization from an operational
	cost center to a value added thought partner. This resulted in a
	significantly improved culture and effectiveness of the support organization.
	This unique organization of an agile, cross-functional and team-based
	approach to handle support requests improved the customer experience,
	reduced support costs, and ultimately provided greater opportunity
	for the business to fund new development efforts.},

  abstract = {Scrum is one of the many agile approaches to software development
	that have been widely adopted over the past decade. Agile processes
	allow developers to embrace under-defined problems in complex environments
	where change in requirements is inevitable. The key agile features
	of Scrum are a flexible, adaptive schedule; democratic, collaborative
	teams; and frequent, iterative project and process reviews [2]. While
	students may engage with Scrum in the context of software development,
	the characteristics that suit many software problems to an agile
	approach also describe the student learning environment: complexity
	(new and unfamiliar concepts), under-defined problem space (students
	don't know what they don't know), short timeframe with frequent meetings
	(terms and class meetings), and inevitable change (apply new knowledge).
	This makes Scrum not only a software development strategy but a general
	learning strategy. Scrum facilitates frequent and iterative practice
	with timely feedback, development of mastery, and self-direction
	[1]. In this panel, the participants will describe how their students
	learn and practice Scrum in a software development context, how they

  abstract = {Coalition formation is an active and essential component for multi-agent
	systems (MAS) in task-oriented domains in which tasks can be too
	complicated to be accomplished by a single agent with insufficient
	resources. By forming a coalition, agents are able to cooperate and
	combine resources to complete tasks that are impossible to accomplish
	alone within a given time bound. For example, in virtual enterprises,
	small and agile enterprises can provide more services and make more
	profits than an individual can. In many multi-task environments,
	especially in parallel multi-task environments, an individual abundant
	in resources is inclined to undertake more than one task to make
	more profits and participate in multiple virtual organizations (MVOs)
	at the same time, where every member has to decide how to allocate
	different parts of its resources to serve multiple different project
	tasks. Such overlapping property is a very intractable problem in
	practical decision making, and to the best of our knowledge, current
	coalition formation algorithms typically exclude the possibility
	of having overlapping coalitions, that is an agent can only be a
	member of one coalition at any given time, leading to waste of resources,
	preventing the system from efficiently allocating all agents' resources,
	and limiting the scope of their applications in real-world scenarios.
	Indeed, overlapping coalition formation (OCF) is an important research
	question, because MVOs are very crucial and beneficial in parallel
	multi-task domains where only a few selected individuals have rare,
	but highly demanded, resources. With this in mind, we develop a discrete
	particle swarm optimization based algorithm to solve the OCF problem
	in MVOs, applicable for more complex virtual enterprises environments.
	We introduce a two-dimensional binary encoding scheme and propose
	a novel repairing strategy for resolving conflicts over the usage
	of joint resources among overlapping coalitions. With this novel
	strategy for cooperative conflict resolution, any invalid encoding
	can be adjusted into a valid one without any resource conflict. Finally,
	simulations are conducted to show the efficiency of the proposed
	algorithm. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	the current practices suggest that security should be considered
	during all stages of the software development life cycle. In order
	to address the aforementioned issue, this paper proposes the integration
	of security principles in development phases using scrum and suggests
	the element of security backlog that can be used as security features

	development life cycle model. However, more software projects are
	using the spiral development life cycle model. Software developers

	The spiral model uses iterative steps that can create changes in

	to ensure the application has few flaws or vulnerabilities that could
	be exploited. Failure to impose the right security measures at each
	of these phases can open up vulnerabilities for hackers to exploit
	and prove costly in patching. This paper will explore areas where
	security can be engaged within each iteration step of the spiral
	development model. This way security can continue protection of the
	software product as it becomes ready for deployment. The paper will
	help organizations realize where to deploy security measures to reduce

	that involve the monitoring of various physical phenomena. However,
	WSNs are subject to many threats. In particular, lack of pervasive

	compromise. Having compromised a sensor, the adversary learns all
	the sensor secrets, allowing it to later encrypt/decrypt or authenticate
	messages on behalf of that sensor. This threat is particularly relevant
	in the novel unattended wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) scenario.
	UWSNs operate without constant supervisionby a trusted sink. UWSN's
	unattended nature and increased exposure to attacks prompts the need
	for special techniques geared towards regaining security after being
	compromised. In this article, we investigate cooperative self-healing

  abstract = {Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) is a new computing paradigm that
	utilizes services as the basic constructs to support the development
	of rapid, low-cost and easy composition of distributed applications
	even in heterogeneous environments. The promise of Service-Oriented
	Computing is a world of cooperating services where application components
	are assembled with little effort into a network of services that
	can be loosely coupled to create flexible dynamic business processes
	and agile applications that may span organizations and computing
	platforms. The subject of Service-Oriented Computing is vast and
	enormously complex, spanning many concepts and technologies that
	find their origins in diverse disciplines that are woven together
	in an intricate manner. In addition, there is a need to merge technology
	with an understanding of business processes and organizational structures,
	a combination of recognizing an enterprise's pain points and the
	potential solutions that can be applied to correct them. The material
	in research spans an immense and diverse spectrum of literature,
	in origin and in character. As a result research activities are very
	fragmented. This necessitates that a broader vision and perspective
	be established - one that permeates and transforms the fundamental
	requirements of complex applications that require the use of the
	Service-Oriented Computing paradigm. This paper provides a Service
	Oriented Computing Roadmap and places on-going research activities
	and projects in the broader context of this roadmap. This research
	roadmap launches four pivotal, inherently related, research themes
	to Service-Oriented Computing: service foundations, service composition,
	service management and monitoring and service-oriented engineering.

	program correctness and correctness preserving program refinements.
	It serves as the foundation for an object-oriented software, architecture
	and construction method that we refer to as stepwise feature introduction
	(SFI) {[}3]. Characteristic for this approach is that each software
	module is described in terms of thin layers. Each layer extends the
	software with some new feature, in a way that preserves the features
	that have been introduced by earlier layers. This amounts to requiring
	that the new layer is a superposition refinement {[}4] of the layers
	below. The modules are interconnected using interface specifications,
	usually providing a more abstract view of the module state than what
	will actually be implemented. The implementation is required to be
	a data refinement {[}9,6] of the interface specification. SFI is
	based on structuring software with these two basic mechanisms, modularization
	and extension, while the refinement calculus provides the formal
	framework for reasoning about the correctness of software constructed
	in this way. We use UML {[}8] to describe the software architecture,
	with refinement calculus providing a rigorous mathematical semantics
	for the UML constructs employed. This will also give us a formal
	framework for reasoning about UML class diagrams, in essence using
	these as proof schemes when arguing about software properties. SFI
	goes well in hand with an extreme programming (XP) {[}7] approach
	to constructing software, with feature introductions corresponding
	to the iteration cycles in XP. We can look at SFI as providing a
	general software architecture for XP, and we can look at XP as providing
	a software process for SFI. We will report on some experiments where
	these two approaches have been combined {[}2]. We will also discuss
	in more detail how the notions of unit tests in XP can be generalized
	to requirement specifications in SFI.},

  abstract = {The development of security-critical large-scale distributed software
	systems is a difficult and error prone process. As we learnt from
	practical experiences, it is especially difficult to manually define
	and manage security policies, for example for access control, with
	a sufficient level of assurance. The human security administrator
	is not able to cope with the high complexity of the interactions
	of the application and the low level, platform specific security
	policy. Therefore, a new approach is needed to improve the correctness
	of the security policies, and to make security policies manageable.
	This is particularly eminent in two areas: service-oriented architecture
	(SOA) style environments where agility support and reuse (also of
	policies!) are critical; and in environments where collaborative
	decision making (CDM) has to be implemented, which typically requires
	agile secure information sharing (especially sensitive cross-organisation
	between coalition partners). This paper shows how security engineering
	can be integrated into a model-driven software development process.
	In our approach, UML models of the application's functional properties
	are flexibly augmented with security relevant information. Together
	with a high level security policy defined by the security administrator,
	this augmented functional model is then used in an automatic model
	transformation to generate the platform specific security policy
	with high assurance. With this approach, which also supports the
	separation of concerns in model based software engineering, we can
	automatically generate security-critical applications for different
	middleware platforms like our SecureMiddleware, which is an extended
	implementation of the CORBA Components Model with improved support
	for properties like security. The concepts, platforms and tools presented
	in the paper are currently used for the development of several large-scale
	and secure applications, for example for building a Virtual Air-Space
	Management System with strong security requirements, and within the
	U.S. Naval Research Lab SINS project.},

	however are seldom matched upon project completion. In our opinion,
	more effort is needed to study and model the inner structure and
	behavior of these approaches, highlighting positive and negative
	feedback loops that are strategic to understand their features, and
	to decide on their adoption. In this paper we analyze the dynamic
	behavior of the adoption of Kanban and Scrum, versus a traditional
	software development process such as the Waterfall approach. We use
	a system dynamics model, based on the relationships between system
	variables, to assess the relative benefits of the studied approaches.
	The model is simulated using a commercial tool. The proposed model
	visualizes the relationships among these software development processes,
	and can be used to study their relative advantages and disadvantages.

	primary strategies for requirements prioritization in order to incorporate
	the benefits of both plan-based (PB) and agile development methods
	while avoiding their drawbacks. As it is intractable to directly
	study the performance of strategies on real projects, we conducted
	a comprehensive empirically based simulation under a variety of conditions
	of requirements dynamism, project size, and duration. Simulation
	results suggest that a mixed strategy for requirements prioritization
	seems to work best in all but cost for typical levels of dynamism
	on average. Our findings also indicate that, as theorized, PB and
	agile strategies perform well within opposite extremes of dynamism.
	However, they do not outperform the mixed strategies even within
	their home grounds- that is large and complex systems with stable
	requirements for PB, and small and dynamic projects for agile methods.
	Given the unknown, unknowable, or variable nature of dynamism and
	the dramatic differences in effectiveness for agile and PB strategies
	under extreme development scenarios, a mixed strategy appears to
	yield the best results overall. We introduce two mixed strategies-
	simply adding cost-benefit (CB) to the agile approach, and a more
	sophisticated hybrid (HY) approach that modulates development iteration
	size to maximize the expected CB for each iteration. We propose a
	step-by-step method to implement this HY strategy. We provide a structured
	analysis of the benefits and assumptions of agile and PB requirements
	prioritization methods (e.g., Pareto optimization), and outline a
	framework for analyzing and assessing the effectiveness of strategies
	including several new metrics. This research can furthermore serve
	as a framework for future validation of the proposed mixed strategies

  abstract = {Despite advances in situational method engineering, many software
	organizations continue to adopt an ad-hoc mix of method fragments
	from well-known development methods such as Scrum or XP, based on
	their perceived suitability to project or organizational needs. With
	the increasing availability of empirical evidence on the success
	or failure of various software development methods and practices
	under different situational conditions, it now becomes feasible to
	make this evidence base systematically accessible to practitioners
	so that they can make informed decisions when creating situational
	methods for their organizations. This paper proposes a framework
	for evaluating the suitability of candidate method fragments prior
	to their adoption in software projects. The framework makes use of
	collected knowledge about how each method fragment can contribute
	to various project objectives, and what requisite conditions must
	be met for the fragment to be applicable. Pre-constructed goal models
	for the selected fragments are retrieved from a repository, merged,
	customized with situational factors, and then evaluated using a qualitative
	evaluation procedure adapted from goal-oriented requirements engineering.

	of the most rapidly evolving areas of communications. Modeling of
	domain-dependent aspects is a key prerequisite for the design of

	less advanced model of selected aspects of the domain in which they
	are used. However, the traditional development approach to business
	applications, data base and general software is not suitable for
	mobile devices of the different paradigms. In this paper, we discuss
	the creation of such a model and its relevance for technical design
	of mobile software applications. The paper also reports from an empirical
	study where a methodology that combines both of these approaches
	was introduced and employed for modeling of the domain-dependent
	aspects that were relevant for the design of a mobile software component.
	The resulting models of domain-dependent aspects are presented, and
	the experiences from the modeling process are discussed. It strongly
	focus on the lightweight mobile service oriented common framework
	architectures for business applications running on mobile devices.
	It is concluded that a dual perspective based on both of the conventional
	approaches is relevant for capturing the aspects that are necessary
	for creating the domain-dependent models that are integrated in a
	mobile software system. As an architect, you are often challenged
	- by client enterprise architects and IT stakeholders - to articulate
	Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) patterns and service components
	in a nonproprietary, product-agnostic way. In this paper, use Unified
	Modeling Language (UML) models to describe the SOA architecture pattern

  title = {Software cost estimation for Fractionated Space Systems},
  year = {2008},
  note = {cited By (since 1996) 0},
  abstract = {Fractionated Space Systems, as exemplified by Defense Advanced Research
	Projects Agency's Future Fast, Flexible, Fractionated, Free-Flying
	Spacecraft united by Information eXchange (DARPA's System F6), represent
	real challenges to software cost estimation. The concept is a traditional
	'monolithic' spacecraft is replaced by a cluster of wirelessly interconnected
	spacecraft modules to create a virtual satellite, delivering capability
	which is at least equivalent to the monolithic spacecraft. Concurrently,
	they significantly enhance flexibility and system robustness, and
	reduce risk throughout the mission life and the spacecraft development
	cycle. Such systems present real challenges to software cost estimation
	which arise from both the concept of a Directed System of Systems
	(DSOS) and the reduced risk which is primarily achievable only through
	the application of an Incremental Commitment Model (ICM). This paper
	will briefly introduce a next-generation synthesis of the spiral
	model and other leading process models into the ICM, which is being
	piloted or considered for adoption in some parts of Department of
	Defense (DoD). The ICM emphasizes architecting systems (or DSOSs)
	to encapsulate subsystems (or systems) undergoing the most rapid
	change; and architecting the incremental development process by having
	agile systems engineers handling longer-range change traffic to rebaseline
	the plans for future increments while largely plandriven teams develop
	and continuously verify and validate (V&V) the current increment,
	as is usually required for safe or secure software. One approach
	being followed for estimating the software development cost of the
	Fractionated Space Craft Systems of Systems (FSSOS) is based on the
	Constructive Incremental Commitment Cost Model (COINCOMO) model and
	its tool which currently implements together in one tool the Constructive
	Cost Model (COCOMO II), the Constructive Phased Schedule and Effort
	Model (COPSEMO) and a Constructive Security Cost Model (COSECMO).
	COINCOMO has an added super-structure to accommodate multiple suppliers
	of independent software subsystems and multiple builds (or incremental
	deliveries). Many software systems components today rely on Commercial-Off-the-Shelf
	(COTS) sub-components and/or reuse of (potentially proprietary) open-source
	or legacy components which are treated like COTS components rather

	to rebaseline the plans for future increments. Systems engineers
	do this, while largely plan-driven teams develop and continuously

	for safe or secure software. Our approach for estimating software
	development cost of systems is the Constructive Incremental Commitment

  abstract = {At the IBM Almaden Research Center, we have been working with other
	divisions of IBM, offering Software Development as a Service (SDaaS).
	We work with our colleagues to understand their business and pain
	points, and then leverage that knowledge to build an application
	that at least meets, but ideally exceeds their needs. In our experience,
	applications built in the mode of Software Development as a Service
	have the following characteristics. There is a single client that
	owns the program requirements, the requirements are not fully formed,
	and, the software is at least partly, if not completely, custom.
	With many decades of software development experience in our group,
	we have used many different techniques for conducting software projects.
	In SDaaS, the style of interaction between the client team and the
	development team is a natural fit for Agile Software Development
	methods. Although our conditions do not fit the ideal Agile Software
	Development project profile, we have consistently experienced significant
	gains from taking the approach of iterative and incremental development.
	We have used the Waterfall, or plan-based, method many times for
	past projects, and we have consistently paid a significant price
	for the ``Big Design Up Front{''} problems that go with that type
	of schedule. Although agile methods have consistently outperformed
	other methods in the early stages of a project, they do less well
	as the application program grows and the project matures. Once an
	application is in production and has an established user base, the
	emphasis of the client and development teams change from fast, easy
	and elegant feature additions to stability, release planning and
	maintenance. The imposition of a fixed schedule naturally transitions
	the overall project management into a plan-based model. However,
	we came to realize that agile methods still play an essential role,
	even when the overall project has matured to a steady state and is
	managed in a plan-based fashion. When de- - veloping a new program
	requirement, unless it is completely understood (i.e. all aspects
	and expected results documented), then it must go through an agile
	prototyping phase in order for it to be properly developed and scheduled.
	That agile prototyping phase is still bound inside a plan-based schedule,
	but that leaves room for iteration and innovation that we would not
	otherwise have in a fixed schedule. In this paper, we examine the
	various forces that influence both the client and development organizations
	that are engaged in Software Development as a Service. Using several
	projects from our past as examples, we show that the level of program
	technology and requirement understanding determines which development
	method will be more successful. Plan-based methods will work if all
	aspects of the project are known and there are minimal variables.
	Otherwise, our experience shows that an Agile Development model is
	likely to be the best choice for the beginning of a project. Once
	a project reaches steady state, with production releases, then a
	hybrid model works best, where agile methods are used to prototype
	new features, but bounded inside of a plan-based schedule.},

	To confine the feedback loops between consecutive stages and minimize
	the expensive rework involved in feedback across many stages, Fagan
	(1979) introduced in 1974, in IBM Kingston, NY, a method of static
	testing called the inspection process. The method involves the developer

	meets his requirements. However, the waterfall model has encountered
	some fundamental difficulties in taking into account current approaches
	to software engineering, including rapid prototyping for interactive
	end-user applications, object orientation, software reuse, or re-engineering.
	Boehm (1988) suggested a spiral model, creating a risk-driven approach
	for improving the software development process situation. This article
	opens with a short description of both the software development process
	and the inspection process. Subsequent sections illustrate the application

	and South Africa (SA). With an increasing number of Information Technology
	(IT) investors, both countries are recognised as IT hubs in the Southern
	African region. Furthermore, due to a diverse cultural setting prevailing
	in Mauritius and SA, particular software development methods which
	are in concurrence with those cultures might be employed. It is thus
	useful to explore how existing software development methods, particularly
	the Waterfall and the Rational Unified Process (RUP) might be employed
	in these cultural. The research method adopted for the study was
	qualitative and empirical in nature. Multiple case studies were conducted
	in Mauritius and SA and data was collected through semi-structured
	interviews. The data collection and analysis processes were guided
	by the Grounded Theory techniques due to the limited number of GSD
	studies conducted in the Mauritian and SA contexts. Based on the
	results, the paper posits that companies engaging themselves in GSD
	in Mauritius and SA are adapting software development methods (Waterfall
	and RUP) to fit their cultural needs. In essence, the methods employed
	blend some form of flexibility and rigour to drive GSD projects towards
	success. The software development methods are thus employed to mitigate
	cultural issues. Another major outcome of this study is that GSD
	teams have a direct impact on the effective use of the software development
	methods. For instance, the level of skills of the GSD team members
	impacts on the effective application of the software development
	methods during the GSD projects. Results of this study might thus
	be useful to practitioners wishing to engage in GSD in Mauritius

	such as NUnit significantly simplify the task of programming tests

	introduced validation oriented approaches, such as FIT, provide a
	much more concise and easy to understand description of test logic,
	but cannot cope with code-level testing. In this paper we present
	a new metaphor for test definition and reporting, referred to as
	``test sheets{''}, that combines the expressive strength of JUnit
	with the visual simplicity of tabular approaches such as FIT. After
	discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the technologies used

  abstract = {Adult caddisflies were collected at 12 sites along a 5 km stretch
	of a forested headwater stream in southeastern Ghana in March and
	November 1993 and the catches are related to environmental variables.
	Some 34,000 specimens, belonging to 178 morphospecies in 43 genera
	and 11 families, were caught with Malaise traps and light traps.
	Many species demonstrate differences between sampling method, seasonal
	occurrence, and sex-ratios, with the light trap in the second wet
	sunny season (November) being most efficient with respect to the
	diversity of the catches. A Moran index analysis for global structures
	indicates a major transition in the fauna from the ravine with waterfalls
	to the forest, and secondly, a gradient through the forest. A Geary
	index analysis for local structures indicates further faunal turnovers
	in the lower reaches of the stream. Species-environment relationships
	were analyzed through correspondence analysis and co-inertia analysis,
	allowing ordination of both species and the environment into three
	zones. The first co-inertia axis reveals a transition between the
	waterfalls in the open ravine (sites 1-3), and the stream through
	the riverine forest (sites 4-12), while the second co-inertia axis
	reveals a gradient from the lotic stream in the moist semi-deciduous
	forest (sites 4-8) to more lentic stretches of the stream in a gradually
	more depleted forest (sites 9-12). The most important environmental
	factors related to the species transition are: riparian moss growth
	(r = 0.94), leaves in the stream substratum (r = 0.91), forest type
	(r = 0.90), hygropetric surfaces (r = 0.88), bedrock (r = 0.87),
	lotic [riffle] (r = 0.85) and lentic [pool] (r = 0.85) stretches.
	The most important environmental factors related to the species gradient
	are: lotic [riffle] stretches (r = 0.92), gravel (r = 0.88) and leaves
	(r = 0.85) in the stream substratum, forest type (r=0.81), and agricultural
	use (r=0.76). Three clusters representing three major environmental
	zones (zone I, II and III) along the stream are identified by projecting
	the average species positions on the co-inertia plane. By analyzing
	the Malaise trap samples significant indicator values are found for
	29 species in zone I, 16 species in zone II, and 18 species in zone
	III. By analyzing the light trap samples significant indicator values
	are found for 17 species in zone I, 57 species in zone II, and 38
	species in zone III. The high diversity of caddisflies in the sanctuary
	might be reflected both in the geological and climatological history
	of West Africa, as well as in the recognition of three major environmental
	zones, and the clean water with high diversity of stream microhabitats
	favorable for Trichoptera larvae. The closed forest seems to play
	an important role for the Trichoptera community, and the study demonstrates
	the importance of protecting forested headwater streams in order
	to maintain a sustainable aquatic biodiversity in tropical Africa.

	paradigm, based on the classical Waterfall development model (W.W.
	Royce, 1970). The stages are systems analysis, software specification,
	design, and implementation. The systems analysis and software specification
	stages are covered. An informal, transaction-oriented method for
	systems analysis is proposed. The resulting system specification
	involves two parts: a high-level specification of each transaction
	and a formal specification of the system's control flow, i.e., the
	order of execution of the transactions. The system's control flow
	is expressed in a formal language describing concurrent regular expressions
	built on transaction names. At the software specification stage,
	some operational requirements, such as connect/disconnect transactions
	and the application of the all-or-nothing principle, are added to
	the system specification. Then a serial product automaton (SPA) is
	used to transform the concurrent expression into a single regular
	expression. This result is proven to be consistent with the system

  note = {cited By (since 1996) 19},
  abstract = {Today, the largest and most desirable portion of the radio spectrum
	is allocated to licensed services, which has resulted in the well-known
	profound scarcity of this resource for emerging applications. With
	the rapid growth of wireless technologies, current spectrum scarcity
	has become a serious problem as more and more wireless applications
	compete for very little spectrum. On the other hand, the licensed
	spectrum allocated to applications such as television, cellular telephony
	and public safety show very little usage over time at different geographical
	locations. This has, therefore, seriously impaired the evolution
	of newer technologies because of current regulatory constraints on
	the operation in licensed spectrum, such as TV bands, and is being
	addressed by FCC through recent rule makings. With the goal of ubiquitous
	communication in mind, we look into spectrum agile radios as a new
	technology enabled by such emerging regulatory rulings and study
	its advantages over conventional radios. Initially, we provide a
	simple mathematical modeling to understand the utilization that is
	achievable by spectrum agile radios. Next, we investigate several
	issues related to spectrum sensing, as it is one of the key pillars
	to realize spectrum agile radios. Through sensing, the spectrum agile
	radio identifies the so-called ``white-spaces{''} in the spectrum
	and then decides whether to occupy those white spaces opportunistically
	to transmit data. We also discuss the concept of interference temperature
	introduced by the FCC, and propose a spectrum-aware sensor network
	as a way to address it. Finally, we extend this spectrum-aware sensor
	networks to introduce a new sensing architecture to identify and
	locate white spaces in the spectrum. © 2005 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Background. The explosive epidemics of dengue that have been occurring
	in various countries have stimulated investigation into new approaches
	to improve understanding of the problem and to develop new strategies
	for controlling the disease. The objective of this study was to evaluate
	the characteristics of diffusion of the first dengue epidemic that
	occurred in the city of Salvador in 1995. Methods. The epidemiological
	charts and records of notified cases of dengue in Salvador in 1995
	constituted the source of data. The cases of the disease were georeferenced
	according to census areas (spatial units) and epidemiological weeks
	(temporal unit). Kernel density estimation was used to identify the
	pattern of spatial diffusion using the R-Project computer software
	program. Results. Of the 2,006 census areas in the city, 1,400 (70%)
	registered cases of dengue in 1995 and the spatial distribution of
	these records revealed that by the end of 1995 practically the entire
	city had been affected by the virus, with the largest concentration
	of cases occurring in the western region, composed of census areas
	with a high population density and predominantly horizontal residences
	compared to the eastern region of the city, where there is a predominance
	of vertical residential buildings. Conclusion. The pattern found
	in this study shows the characteristics of the classic process of
	spreading by contagion that is common to most infectious diseases.
	It was possible to identify the epicenter of the epidemic from which
	centrifugal waves of the disease emanated. Our results suggest that,
	if a more agile control instrument existed that would be capable
	of rapidly reducing the vector population within a few days or of
	raising the group immunity of the population by means of a vaccine,
	it would theoretically be possible to adopt control actions around
	the epicenter of the epidemic and consequently reduce the incidence
	of the disease in the city. This finding emphasizes the need for
	further research to improve the technology available for the prevention

	maximizes the business value perceived by users. The planning problem
	is converted into a multi-knapsack problem with constraints, given
	a linear programming formulation, and solved using the IBM ILOG CPLEX
	Optimizer. Finally, the proposed approach is validated through effectiveness

  abstract = {The number of possible refactorings is unlimited, so no tool vendor
	will ever be able to provide custom refactorings for all specific
	user needs. Therefore, we propose a new kind of refactoring tools,
	which allow users to create, edit and compose required refactorings
	just like any other documents. The heart of such a refactoring editor
	is the ability to compose larger refactorings from existing ones.
	Computing the precondition of the composite refactoring from the
	preconditions of the composed refactorings is non-trivial since earlier
	transformations influence the truth of preconditions of later ones.
	The ability to calculate these effects without referring to a particular
	program to which the refactorings should be applied is called program-independent
	composition. It is the prerequisite for creating composite refactorings
	that are reusable on arbitrary programs. The main contribution of
	this paper is a formal model for automatic, program-independent composition
	of conditional program transformations. We show that conditional
	transformations, including refactorings, can be composed from a limited
	set of basic operations. Program-independent derivation of a precondition
	for the composite is based on the notion of ``transformation description{''},
	which can be seen as a simplified, yet equally powerful, variant
	of Roberts' ``postconditions{''} (Practical analysis for refactoring,
	Ph.D. Thesis (1999)). Our approach simplifies the implementation
	of refactoring tools - only the basic operations and the ability
	for composition must be hard coded in a tool. As a proof of concept,
	we sketch a transformation framework that implements our approach
	(jConditioner) and, based on the framework, an experimental refactoring
	tool (ConTraCT) that includes the editing capabilities that motivated
	our work. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Under the CE methodology, sequential tasks can only be performed

	finite number of possible alternative subsequent tasks, we propose
	that a more agile approach is to begin work on these alternative
	subsequent tasks concurrently to the preceding task, sharing the
	resource needed for the subsequent task amongst the different alternatives.
	Further, where the probability for each alternative task is known,
	we demonstrate that by setting the resource allocation equal to the
	probabilities of each outcome, it is possible dynamically allocate
	resources to minimise the expected completion of the overall project.
	A simple classically sequential two task case study is developed
	and analysed to illustrate this method. The paper concludes by revisiting
	the original assumptions and discussing how resource efficiency is
	traded off for minimising project completion time.},

	one of the most successful examples of a company transitioning from
	traditional management to radical management. Design/methodology/approach:
	The article explores the factors that made the implementation successful
	and identifies the pitfalls that were avoided. Salesforce.com provides
	on-demand services for customer-relationship management. Findings:
	Salesforce.com has had more spectacular results than most other companies
	that have adopted the radical management principles of Scrum. Research
	limitations/implications: Over the past five years Salesforce.com
	has delivered a 41 percent annual return to shareholders. This extraordinary
	performance - in fact, an example of an innovation turnaround - occurred
	after the firm instituted a set of radical practices that make it
	a model for business seeking to grow though continuous innovation.
	Practical implications: The leadership at Salesforce.com saw that
	if a radically different approach to management were to be introduced
	in one part of the organization, there would be a tension at the
	interface between the part of the company still doing traditional
	management and the part managing work in the new way. So they opted
	to go all out with change right across the whole organization. Originality/value:
	What made Salesforce.com different is that when it innovativeness
	was threatened it adopted a radically different way of managing work.
	It implemented a set of agile, customer-driven, outcome-oriented,
	iterative management practices known in software development as Scrum.

  abstract = {Military applications are relying more and more on Commercial Off-The-Shelf
	(COTS) hardware and software to build their information infrastructure.
	However, many COTS applications have been designed for wired infrastructure
	networks, where bandwidth and latency are not a problem, and exhibit
	severe performance problems when deployed in Tactical Edge Networks.
	To address the issues that traditional transport protocols, such

	transport protocol solutions specifically developed for Tactical
	Edge Networks. However, these solutions require modifications to
	the applications in order to be adopted. This paper presents the
	Agile Computing Middleware (ACM) NetProxy: a proxy-based approach
	to support the deployment of COTS applications on Tactical Edge Networks.

  note = {cited By (since 1996) 12},
  abstract = {During their usage, software systems have to be changed constantly.
	If such changes are implemented in an incomplete or inconsistent
	way a loss of architectural quality will occur, i.e. in terms of
	maintainability and understandability. The lack of traceability of
	the impact of changed requirements in the software enhances this
	effect. Traceability links have been proposed as a link between the
	requirements and the different parts of a solution. In practical
	use, these links are difficult to establish and maintain. Currently,
	tools cannot effectively support these links due to human-required
	decisions. This paper introduces feature models as an intermediate
	element for linking requirements to design models. They enable a
	more appropriate bridging of the different levels of abstraction.
	Feature models group sets of requirements to a feature and enable
	a modeling of the variability of requirements. The feature models
	structure traceability links between requirements, design elements
	and implementation parts. This leads to lower efforts of establishing
	and maintaining the links. Furthermore, descriptions of design decisions
	can be attached to the links. Industrial experience with this approach
	shows its support for the evolutionary development of large software

	of electronic commerce, management of information systems, and decision
	support systems. Today, many companies face the problem that they
	have to reengineer pre-existing information systems to take advantage
	of these technologies. Various computer-aided reengineering tools
	have been developed to reduce the complexity of the reengineering
	task. A major limitation of current approaches, however, is that
	they impose a strictly phase-oriented, waterfall-type reengineering
	process, with little support for iterations. Still, such iterations
	often occur in real-world examples, e.g., when additional knowledge
	about the legacy system becomes available or when the legacy system
	is modified during an ongoing migration process. In this paper, we
	present an approach to incremental consistency management that allows
	to overcome this limitation in the domain of database systems by
	integrating reverse and forward engineering activities in an intertwined
	process. The described mechanism is based on a formalization of conceptual
	schema translation and redesign transformations by graph rewriting

	to identify empirical studies relating to agile usage. We followed
	the guidelines provided for conducting systematic literature reviews
	in software engineering [<u>1, 2</u>] using the following distinct
	stages: 1) protocol development and the search strategy, 2) exclusion

	significance of nine critical factors that impact sustained usage

	West Coast and the other from the Philippines. The acrocirrid genus
	now contains three named species, Swima bombiviridis, Swima fulgida
	sp. nov., and Swima tawitawiensis sp. nov. Swima are holopelagic,
	occurring only in the water column, and thus far have only been observed
	below 2700 m. The worms are relatively large, sometimes reaching
	over 30 mm in length and 5 mm in width. They have gelatinous bodies
	and fans of long swimming chaetae, which are flattened into paddles
	in S. tawitawiensis sp. nov. Members of Swima are distinguished from
	other swimming acrocirrids by their transparent bodies, single medial
	subulate branchiae, and simple nuchal organs that do not skirt the
	bases of lateral subulate branchiae. Swima fulgida sp. nov. is distinguished
	from other members of the genus by its darkly pigmented anterior
	gut, whereas S. tawitawiensis sp. nov. is distinguished by possessing
	three subulate head appendages instead of just one and by the shape
	of its noto- and neurochaetae. Swima species possess four pairs of
	elliptical, transformed segmental branchiae that produce green bioluminescence
	when autotomized. These 'bombs' were observed in various states of

  abstract = {Introduction: Electronic syndromic surveillance may have value in
	detecting emerging pathogens or a biological weapons release. Hospitals
	that have an agile process to evaluate chief complaints of patients
	seeking emergency care may be able to more quickly identify subtle
	changes in the community's health. An easily adaptable prototype
	system was developed to monitor emergency department patient visits
	during the Kentucky Derby Festival in Louisville, Kentucky, from
	April 16-May 14, 2002. Use of the system was continued during the
	same festival periods in 2003 and 2004. Method: Twelve area hospitals
	in Louisville, Kentucky, participated in a prospective analysis of
	the chief symptoms of patients who sought care in the emergency department
	during the Kentucky Derby Festival during 2002. Six hospitals were
	classified as computer record groups (CRG) and used their existing
	computerized record capabilities. The other 6 hospitals used a personal
	digital assistant (PDA) with customized software (PDA group). Data
	were evaluated by the health department epidemiologist using SaTScan,
	a modified version of a cancer cluster detection program, to look
	for clusters of cases above baseline over time and by Zip code. Results:
	All 12 hospitals were able to collect and provide data elements during
	the study period. The 6 CRG hospitals were able to perform daily
	data transmission; however, 3 CRG hospitals were unable to interpret
	their data because it was transmitted in pure text format. In contrast,
	data from all 6 PDA group hospitals were interpretable. Real-time
	data analysis was compared with postevent data, and it was found
	that the real-time evaluation correctly identified no unusual disease
	activity during the study period. Conclusions: The 12 hospitals participating
	in this study demonstrated that community-wide surveillance using
	computerized data was possible and that the 6 study hospitals using
	a PDA could quickly interpret emergency department patients' chief
	complaints. The emergency department chief complaints group could
	serve as a disease sentinel for the community. Copyright © 2005 by

  abstract = {Introduction: Advancements in IT and the growing trend for virtual
	information have influenced the need for enabling technologies. Enterprise
	networking and computing are the central technology for practice
	and delivery in health sciences, which are one of the knowledge areas
	to gain most from these developments. The Web has come to serve as
	an everyday platform for learning were academics, researchers, students
	and professionals need access to the most current information. Portals
	are currently a gateway to information and services on the Web and
	it would be difficult to work in any IT related field without them.
	The Centre for Biomedical Image Analysis (CAIBCO) at the Institute
	for Tropical Diseases, Universidad Central de Venezuela, has as one
	of its goals the dissemination of biomedical research knowledge generated
	by the academia in the Ibero-American region. Although there are
	well-known prestigious first-world institutions working in this field,
	the pathologies behave differently in different countries. Malaria
	in Africa and the Americas has diverse transmission modalities, having
	also different prevention strategies, Sparganum Proliferum a rare
	parasite recently identified in Venezuela has been detected in only
	eight clinical cases world-wide in the past, scorpions of the Genus
	Tytius, the main local cause of envenoming, may be completely unknown
	to medical students in developed regions. Moreover, Venezuela as
	one of the leading countries in the study of tropical diseases has
	academic knowledge that could contribute to the general body of knowledge.
	Methods: A knowledge meta-portal, a portal that is a gateway to other
	portals, was developed (http://caibco.ucv.ve) providing access to
	thematic pages on diseases such as Malaria, Chagas, and Scorpions
	[1]. However, it is more than a site providing content; it offers
	also an integrated set of tools for interactive creation, management
	and publication of biomedical knowledge. The following tools are
	currently available: a virtual conference generator, a digital book
	publisher, and the Vitae tool. VITAE is a digital publication, regularly
	published as a showcase of the work of individual researchers, focused
	at increasing the accessibility and influence of biomedical research
	to health care professionals, students and decision makers in organizations.
	Until recently, the information (e.g.: clinical cases, research papers,
	epidemiological alerts) was manually set up, stored in flat files
	(.html,.doc,.gif,.jpg,.tif,.psd,.ps,.pdf,.ppt,.xls), and published.
	The effort involved in preparing each issue, inflexibility of the
	process, redundancy and lack of data integrity, were some of the
	difficulties encountered. Results: Since 1999, twenty-three issues
	of VITAE have been published, containing clinical cases and on-going
	research reviewed by forty editors in different specialization areas.
	The Vitae Tool is a strategic web application to improve the generation
	and publication of VITAE issues making it easier to set up web pages
	that house publications and that also have links to other outlets.
	It was developed using a 3-tier architecture [4] on a Solaris/Oracle9i
	platform with Java technology [3] and agile development methods [2].
	Discussion: Some of the results obtained since VITAE is being published
	are: on the average 4000 monthly visits, support by local pharmaceutical
	industries, and as its content is certified by qualified researchers
	VITAE is a point of academic reference. Although the potential benefits
	of this type of initiatives are rather obvious, difficulties remain
	in how best to assess the effect of an IT project on technological
	change. The meta-portal and its tools allow a firmer commitment of
	the involved institutions to promote science and technology in the
	region. Through the diffusion of the various research activities
	carried out locally and regionally, it may also facilitate the establishment
	of long-term collaborative research projects and reinforce institutional
	research and teaching links, as well as promote the generation and
	dissemination of new knowledge and relevant information, such as
	statistical data. A further and central question to consider thoroughly
	is the organizational commitment for the continuous gathering and
	updating of information and definition of strategies to guarantee
	effectively that this is done properly. The commitment should endure
	the different possible organizational changes at different levels.},

	Specifically, the panel focuses on the teaching of Extreme Programming
	(XP), which is one of the agile software development methods that
	have received much attention in the last decade. Following its origins
	in the industrial sector, XP has been explored in computer science
	and software engineering education, especially in educator symposiums
	that have been instituted in conferences on agile methods (e.g.,
	[2]). This panel aims at discussing, together with the SIGCSE community,
	why and how to teach software development methods in general and
	XP in particular. Since the teaching of XP is discussed in this panel
	with respect to different courses, we believe that the panel is relevant
	for all SIGCSE members. The panel consists of three parts: A. Introducing
	XP: This short demonstration aims at presenting the essence of XP
	and of its 12 practices. It is conducted through an interactive activity
	with the attendees. B. Panelists presentations: The panelists highlight
	the teaching of XP with respect to different course-levels, as is
	described in what follows: Introductory courses (by Joe Bergin),
	software engineering courses (by James Caristi), capstone courses
	(by Yael Dubinsky), and the implementation of pair programming (one
	of the 12 XP practices) in different courses (by Laurie Williams).
	We believe that these descriptions may provide quite a comprehensive
	picture of how XP can be integrated into computer science and software
	engineering education. In order to strengthen our claim for the introduction
	of XP into the undergraduate computer science and software engineering
	curriculum, a cognitive analysis of XP, which explains how XP supports
	leaning processes, is presented as well (by Orit Hazzan). C. Open

  abstract = {The gas transfer velocity (KL) and related gas transfer coefficient
	(k2 = KLA/V, with A, area and V, volume) at the air-water interface
	are critical parameters in all gas flux studies such as green house
	gas emission, whole stream metabolism or industrial processes. So
	far, there is no theoretical model able to provide accurate estimation
	of gas transfer in streams. Hence, reaeration is often estimated
	with empirical equations. The gas transfer velocity need then to
	be corrected with a temperature coefficient θ = 1.0241. Yet several
	studies have long reported variation in θ with temperature and 'turbulence'
	of water (i.e. θ is not a constant). Here we re-investigate thoroughly
	a key theoretical model (Dobbins model) in detail after discovering
	important discrepancies. We then compare it with other theoretical
	models derived from a wide range of hydraulic behaviours (rigid to
	free continuous surface water, wave and waterfalls with bubbles).
	The results of the Dobbins model were found to hold, at least theoretically
	in the light of recent advances in hydraulics, although the more
	comprehensive results in this study highlighted a higher degree of
	complexity in θ's behaviour. According to the Dobbins model, the
	temperature coefficient θ, could vary from 1.005 to 1.042 within
	a temperature range of 0-35 °C and wide range of gas transfer velocities,
	i.e. 'turbulence' condition (0.005 &lt; KL &lt; 1.28 cm min-1). No
	other theoretical models showed any significant variability in θ
	with change in 'turbulence', and only modest variability in θ with
	change in temperature. However, the other theoretical models did
	not have the same temperature coefficient θ (with 1.000 &lt; θ &lt;
	1.056 within 0-35 °C). A model integrating turbulence and bubble
	mediated gas transfer velocities suggested a lower temperature dependence
	for bubble (1.013&lt;θ &lt; 1.017) than turbulence (1.023&lt;θ &lt;
	1.031) mediated processes. As it stands, the effect of turbulence
	on the temperature dependence of gas transfer at the air-water interface
	has still to be clarified, although many models simulate different
	flow conditions which may explain some of the observed discrepancies.
	We suggest that the temperature dependence curves produced by the
	Dobbins model may be used tentatively as a simple theoretical guide
	for streams with free surface water but not self-aerated flows encountered
	in whitewater rapids, cascades or weirs. Greater awareness of the
	different models and conditions of applications should help choosing
	an appropriate correction. Three case studies investigated the effect
	of the temperature coefficient on reaeration and stream metabolism
	(photosynthesis and respiration). In practice, the temperature correction
	may be an important parameter under constant turbulence conditions,
	but as the range in turbulence increases, the role of temperature
	may become negligible in determining KL, whatever the temperature
	correction. The theoretical models reviewed here are also useful
	references to correct KL values determined using a reference tracer
	gas to a second species of interest. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	development has opened an opportunity for the software engineering
	education community. How can one capitalize on the strengths of agile
	development models while still appealing to established software
	engineering practices? The typical introductory software engineering
	course makes use of a team-based project to reinforce software process
	activities. The project normally runs for one academic term during
	which students are led through life-cycle activities using a modified
	waterfall approach to software development. While useful in teaching
	software engineering process concepts, this approach limits the team's
	ability to utilize feedback from downstream process activities. It
	also limits the students' opportunity to understand process improvement
	from their own experiences. The ability to respond to project change
	is also dampened by the fact that teams do not have the time or resources
	in this format to modify, or refactor the design of a project component
	let alone incorporate a new or modified customer requirement. Agile
	methodologies promote an evolutionary approach to development using
	short incremental release cycles. We report on the experiences of
	conducting a team project in an introductory software engineering
	course using agile development techniques at the Rochester Institute
	of Technology. Teams have the opportunity to experience multiple
	iterations of the software engineering life cycle and evolve a product
	design that allows for discoveries made during implementation and
	through the introduction of changing customer requirements. The project
	integrates the concept of test-driven development. This agile technique
	addresses testing early in the development process and reinforces
	the value of unit testing. The incorporation of agile techniques
	is not only useful for students in an introductory course, but may
	also be applied to upper division software engineering courses.},

  year = {2009},
  note = {cited By (since 1996) 0},
  abstract = {Computer industry workforce skills required continue to change rapidly.
	Newer computer technologies are introduced continually while existing
	ones become obsolete at a faster pace. It is a major challenge to
	evolve a flexible curriculum that can adapt to those rapid and substantial
	changes and that new graduates may be taught with. For example, when
	the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) released the Computer
	Curriculum in 1991, networking was not seen as a major topic area.
	Networking was not a mass-market phenomenon then, and the World Wide
	Web was little more than an idea in the minds of its creators. Today,
	networking and the web have changed the way we do business. Other
	professional organizations, in addition to ACM, such as the Institution
	of Electrical & Electronics Engineering (IEEE), and the American
	Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) are also at the forefront
	of addressing this challenge. They rapidly and continuously strive
	to provide the necessary directions in curriculum content and pedagogy.
	The current ``Language First{''} CSE curriculum globally followed
	has stood the ground for close to five decades; but it has many inherent
	flaws. Some among them include emphasis on language and syntax rather
	than design methodology and problem solving. We put forth a pedagogy
	that is flexible, practical, and is based on the ``Middle-Out Approach{''}
	which is a combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches; typically
	one integrates these two at an intermediate architect's level in
	an attempt to optimize a system. We, however, do not address these
	optimization and integration issues as part of our curriculum, because
	of time limitation. They can be undertaken as part of a Master's
	program. We categorize our undergraduate curriculum into 4 core categories
	namely, software, hardware, human-computer interaction and networking.
	Further each category curriculum is divided into 4 levels: (1) Level
	1 (basic/system level) courses broadly include Software Engineering,
	SOC (System on a Chip) overview, Principles of User Interface Design,
	and Internet technology; (2) Level 2 (intermediate/component level)
	courses include Object Oriented Analysis & Design (OOAD), System
	Level Design, Operating Systems (OS), and Computer Networking; (3)
	Level 3 (higher/expanded level) courses could include Aspect Oriented/Extreme
	Programming, Computer Architecture, Modern Computer Design, OS Design,
	Grid Computing etc; and (4) Level 4 (detailed/micro level) courses
	include Data Structures & Algorithms Analysis and Design, System
	Software & Compiler Design, Digital Design, and Advanced Computer
	Networks. Exploring pedagogy alternatives to the ``Language First{''}
	approach and help disseminate domain knowledge better are key to
	this effort. Further, the proposed curriculum provides stronger design
	emphasis, better match with industry's current and future needs,
	and supports better adaptability. The ``Middle-Out Approach{''} also
	provides a better platform for lifelong learning. The major hurdle
	in the implementation of proposed curriculum would be the dissemination
	of the proposed approach to the CSE fraternity and availability of
	skilled faculty to handle the courses at various levels. Acceptance
	of this approach is more in the mindset of the professors; the ones
	who can see the inherent advantages will embrace this faster. There
	is also a need to develop books with a case-study approach with adequate
	design examples. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2009.},

	been developing the Core Transceiver, a unique multi-band, multi-rate,
	Software Defined Radio. The Core Transceiver operates in four bands
	(225-400 MHz, 560-698 MHz, 1350-1390 MHz, and 1755-1850 MHz) and
	is frequency-agile across these multiple bands, thereby providing
	maximum flexibility in frequency planning. The transceiver supports
	adaptable data rates from 100 kbps to more than 1 Mbps, enabling
	the device to satisfy requirements for sensor-to-sensor communications,
	as well as gateway links. This transceiver utilizes an Orthogonal
	Frequency Division Multiplex (OFDM) waveform for robust operation
	in ground-to-ground multipath environments. The Core Transceiver
	is compact in size (6.5 × 2.85 × 0.8) and designed for energy-constrained

  abstract = {In 2002, at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, during observations of
	space operations teams preparing for the 2003 Mars Exploration Rover
	Missions, the User Centered Technology Group from NASA Ames Research
	Center observed users coping with software interoperability issues.
	The packaging of software in multiple applications, each with its
	own pre-determined set of compartmentalized functions, forced users
	into the role of software integrators.
	
	In 2008 the Mission Control Technologies (MCT) project sought to address
	these issues by replacing multiple NASA Mission Control applications
	with composable user-objects. The primary stakeholders were NASA
	flight controllers and mission operations management.
	
	The feature that sold mission management on the project was that user
	objects modeled their real world counterparts. Once a user object
	was created, say for Space Station telemetry, that object could be
	reused. This meant that the association between a user object and
	it's data needed to happen once, as opposed to previous software
	systems, which required data to be associated with on screen displays
	each time a new display was built.
	
	While we sought to design and develop a new system, it was important
	to realize that the existing software was working, that users were
	familiar with that software from years of use, and the introduction
	of change was potentially disruptive to users.
	
	At the request of our customer, the initial MCT user objects would
	be for telemetry and monitoring of the Space Station. To design the
	software, we used participatory design (PD), in which the users are
	the domain experts and the designers facilitate the sessions. In
	addition to creating the artifacts that the team needed to build
	design specifications, the PD sessions forged bonds between the teams.
	For the users, the PD sessions were often the first time that they
	created explicit representations of their work.
	
	The team used agile development methods. Deliveries to the customer
	were made every three weeks, with a release every twelve weeks. A
	nightly build was available for download. A strategic road map guided
	priorities for design and development.
	
	The agile development cycle resulted in a multi-front set of engagements
	for the user experience team. The nightly build allowed the customer
	to provide daily feedback on features. The strategic road map guided
	priorities for the PD sessions. PD sessions typically lasted for
	several days and were planned. Daily feedback from nightly builds
	was often spontaneous.
	
	While participatory design was the core enabler for the developers
	and the customers to come together to create designs for which all
	felt a sense of ownership, agile development was the enabler that
	pushed the design specs into the world of real code and a working
	product. The constant availability of our product made our progress
	visible to all. This pushed everyone on the team to constantly improve
	it.},

	sensing, and perception, computing, communication, navigation, mission
	package selection and safety/field exercise support was organized,
	initial data collection and evaluation of early sensor/algorithm
	candidates for obstacle detection were completed and an overall system
	control architecture (4D-RCS) consistent with multivehicle maneuver
	and intelligent behaviors was developed. Demo III's technology integration
	contract for four Experimental Unmanned Vehicles was competitively
	awarded in January 98. The integration effort will provide the infrastructure
	required to have troops interact with the technologies through three
	successive development/experimentation cycles. The second year of
	the program will see field evaluations of subsystem technologies,
	completion of preliminary and critical design reviews, and an initial
	troop field exercise. At its conclusion in the summer of 2001 Demo
	III will enable troop experimentation with small, highly agile, unmanned
	vehicles capable of off-road, semi-autonomous operation at speeds
	of up to 32 km/hr during daylight and 16 km/hr at night. These capabilities
	will be integrated with navigation, mission planning and target acquisition
	technologies which will enable a meaningful assessment of the promise
	of autonomous robotic ground vehicles early in the next century.
	Many of the Demo III initiatives will benefit from and/or provide
	technology transfer to other defense and civil sector robotic vehicle
	development programs.},

	Outcome Measurement Information System(PROMIS) aimed to create item
	banks and computerized adaptive tests (CATs) across multiple domains
	forindividuals with a range of chronic diseases. Purpose Web-based
	software was created to enable a researcher to create study-specific
	Websites that could administer PROMIS CATs and other instruments
	to research participants or clinical samples. This paper outlines
	the process used to develop a user-friendly, free, Web-based resource
	(Assessment Center SM) for storage, retrieval, organization, sharing,
	and administration of patient-reported outcomes (PRO) instruments.
	Methods Joint Application Design (JAD) sessions were conducted with
	representatives from numerous institutions in order to supply a general
	wish list of features. Use Cases were then written to ensure that
	end user expectations matched programmer specifications. Program
	development included daily programmer ``scrum{''} sesions, weekly
	Usability Acceptability Testing (UAT) and continuous Quality Assurance
	(QA) activities pre- and post-release. Results Assessment Center
	includes features that promote instrument development including item
	histories, data management, and storage of statistical analysis results.

  abstract = {This paper examines how documentation is used to create ``quality{''}
	engineering processes in software development, focusing on recent
	industry trends of adopting use case driven software engineering
	models, to investigate a phenomenon that in this paper I call ``genre
	dumping. {''} The paper aims to address questions about how software
	development methods change under a use-case driven model. For example,
	is it really that easy to adopt the use case methodology? The paper
	draws from a 24-month case study of a small cross-disciplinary team
	of software designers, developers, testers, and managers who are
	helping build a large in-house application for a multinational financial
	services corporation called ``Financial Capital{''} (pseudonym).
	This project was selected for study because a use case driven model
	was being applied to explicitly change software engineering practices:
	use cases were newly adopted and thus unfamiliar to those involved
	in the software development project. Presented are selected results
	of qualitative and quantitative analyses of textual and interview
	data. The findings are interpreted using rhetorical genre theory,
	which features a large and growing body of workplace research about
	the ways documents enable (and constrain) people to get work done.
	The results show that textual features of the documents of the older
	design methods persist in the newly adopted use cases and that readers'
	approaches to text-related meaning making also persist, indicating
	generic recurrence. The findings also show that conflict occurs at
	the same sites where recurrence occurs. The paper concludes with
	discussions of implications for technical communicators and genre
	theorists interested in technical communication.},

  volume = {15},
  pages = {654-693},

  abstract = {So far, only few in-depth studies focused on the direct comparison
	of process models in general, and between plan-driven and incremental/agile
	approaches in particular. That is, it is not made explicit What the
	effect is of moving from one model to another model. Furthermore,
	there is limited evidence on advantages and issues encountered in
	agile software development, this is specifically true in the context
	of large-scale development. The objective of the paper is to investigate
	how the perception of bottlenecks, unnecessary work, and rework (from
	hereon referred to as issues) changes when migrating from a plan-driven
	to an incremental software development approach with agile practices
	(flexible product backlog, face-to-face interaction, and frequent
	integration), and how commonly perceived these practices are across
	different systems and development roles. The context in which the
	objective should be achieved is large-scale development with a market-driven
	focus. The selection of the context was based on the observation
	in related work that mostly small software development projects were
	investigated and that the investigation was focused on one agile
	model (eXtreme programming). A case study was conducted at a development
	site of Ericsson AB, located in Sweden in the end of 2007. In total
	33 interviews were conducted in order to investigate the perceived
	change when migrating from plan-driven to incremental and agile software
	development, the interviews being the primary source of evidence.
	For triangulation purposes measurements collected by Ericsson were
	considered, the measurements relating to unnecessary work (amount
	of discarded requirements) and rework (data on testing efficiency
	and maintenance effort). Triangulation in this context means that
	the measurements were used to confirm the perceived changes with
	an additional data source. In total 64 issues were identified, 24
	being of general nature and the remaining 40 being local and therefore
	unique to individual's opinions or a specific system. The most common
	ones were documented and analyzed in detail. The commonality refers
	to how many persons in different roles and across the systems studied
	have mentioned the issues for each of the process models. The majority
	of the most common issues relates to plan-driven development. We
	also identified common issues remaining for agile after the migration,
	which were related to testing lead-time, test coverage, software
	release, and coordination overhead. Improvements were identified
	as many issues commonly raised for the plan-driven approach were
	not raised anymore for the incremental and agile approach. It is
	concluded that the recent introduction (start in 2005 with the study
	being conducted in the end of 2007) of incremental and agile practices
	brings added values in comparison to the plan-driven approach, which
	is evident from the absence of critical issues that are encountered
	in plan-driven development.},

	will change. Our re-engineering methods and technologies go well
	beyond the revamping of code. They are based on rigorous and well-established
	techniques that allow the re-engineering to operate at the level
	of the business logic and, therefore, align the system architecture
	with the way markets evolve. The architectural approach that we will
	be describing is based on the crucial separation of concerns between:
	Computation, Coordination, and Configuration. This separation needs
	to be supported at two different levels. On the one hand, through
	semantic primitives that address the ``business architecture{''},
	i.e. the means that need to be provided for modeling business entities
	(Computation), the business rules that determine how the entities
	can interact (Coordination), and the business contexts through which
	specific rules can be superposed, at run-time, to specific entities
	(Configuration).},

  abstract = {We introduce a new kind of diagnostic sensor that combines multifunctional
	measurement capabilities for ionospheric research. Multifunctionality
	is realized through agility in frequency selection over an extended
	band (1.5 to 50 MHz), system modularity, complete system control
	by software written in C, and a user-friendly computer interface.
	This sensor, which we call the frequency-agile radar (FAR), incorporates
	dual radar channels and an arbitrary wave-form synthesizer that allows
	creative design of sophisticated waveforms as a means of increasing
	its sensitivity to weak signals while minimizing loss in radar resolution.
	The sensitivity of the FAR is determined by two sets of power amplifier
	modules: four 4-kW solid-state broadband amplifiers, and four 30-kW
	vacuum tube amplifiers. FAR control is by an AT-bus personal computer
	with on-line processing by a programmable array processor. The FAR
	does not simply house the separate functions of most radio sensors
	in use today, it provides convenient and flexible access to those
	functions as elements to be used in any combination. Some of the
	first new results obtained with the FAR during recent field campaigns
	are presented to illustrate its versatility. These include (1) the
	first detection of anomalous high-frequency (HF) reflections from
	a barium ion cloud, (2) the first evidence of unexpectedly large
	drifts and a shear north of the equatorial electrojet, (3) the first
	HF radar signature of a developing equatorial plasma bubble, and
	(4) the first measurements by a portable radar of altitude-extended,
	quasi-periodic backscatter from midlatitude sporadic E. We also mention
	the potential of the FAR for atmospheric remote sensing.},

	the basic components needed to develop image-guided surgery applications.
	It is intended for fast prototyping and development of image-guided
	surgery applications. The toolkit was developed through a collaboration
	between academic and industry partners. Because IGSTK was designed
	for safety-critical applications, the development team has adopted
	lightweight software processes that emphasizes safety and robustness
	while, at the same time, supporting geographically separated developers.
	A software process that is philosophically similar to agile software
	methods was adopted emphasizing iterative, incremental, and test-driven
	development principles. The guiding principle in the architecture
	design of IGSTK is patient safety. The IGSTK team implemented a component-based
	architecture and used state machine software design methodologies
	to improve the reliability and safety of the components. Every IGSTK
	component has a well-defined set of features that are governed by
	state machines. The state machine ensures that the component is always
	in a valid state and that all state transitions are valid and meaningful.
	Realizing that the continued success and viability of an open source
	toolkit depends on a strong user community, the IGSTK team is following
	several key strategies to build an active user community. These include
	maintaining a users and developers' mailing list, providing documentation

  abstract = {Agile software development practices such as eXtreme Programming (XP)
	and SCRUM have increasingly been adopted to respond to the challenges
	of volatile business environments, where the markets and technologies
	evolve rapidly and present the unexpected. In spite of the encouraging
	results so far, little is known about how agile practices affect
	communication. This article presents the results from a study which
	examined the impact of XP and SCRUM practices on communication within
	software development teams and within the focal organization. The
	research was carried out as a case study in F-Secure where two agile
	software development projects were compared from the communication
	perspective. The goal of the study is to increase the understanding
	of communication in the context of agile software development: internally
	among the developers and project leaders and in the interface between
	the development team and stakeholders (i.e. customers, testers, other
	development teams). The study shows that agile practices improve
	both informal and formal communication. However, it further indicates
	that, in larger development situations involving multiple external
	stakeholders, a mismatch of adequate communication mechanisms can
	sometimes even hinder the communication. The study highlights the
	fact that hurdles and improvements in the communication process can
	both affect the feature requirements and task subtask dependencies
	as described in coordination theory. While the use of SCRUM and some
	XP practices facilitate team and organizational communication of

	Lean Software Development (Lean SD) and others have gained much popularity
	during the last years. Agile methodologies promise faster time-to-market,

	This article presents results of a comparison between typical properties
	of agile methods to the needs of MDPD, as well as findings of a case
	study conducted at Ericsson, an early adopter of agile product development.
	The results show misalignment between the agile principles and needs
	of pre-project activities in market-driven development. This misalignment
	threatens to subtract from the positive aspects of agile development,
	but may be more importantly, threaten the overall product development
	by disabling effective product management. Copyright © 2009 John

	However there has previously been little published empirical evidence

	in March 2006 gathered responses from a large number of software
	development professionals who were using many different methods,
	both traditional and agile. A statistical analysis of this data reveals
	that agile methods do indeed improve outcomes from software development

	a significant increase in cost. However, adoption of methods appears
	to involve a high degree of adaptivity, with many methods being used
	in combination and sets of techniques being adopted on an ad hoc
	basis. In this context, our analysis suggests that choosing specific

  abstract = {This paper presents a qualitative investigation of learning failures
	associated with the introduction of a new software development methodology
	by a project team. This paper illustrates that learning is more than
	the cognitive process of acquiring a new skill; learning also involves
	changes in behaviour and even beliefs. Extreme Programming (XP),
	like other software development methodologies, provides a set of
	values and guidelines as to how software should be developed. As
	these new values and guidelines involve behavioural changes, the
	study investigates the introduction of XP as a new learning experience.
	Researchers use the concepts of single and double-loop learning to
	illustrate how social actors learn to perform tasks effectively and
	to determine the best task to perform. The concept of triple-loop
	learning explains how this learning process can be ineffective, accordingly
	it is employed to examine why the introduction of XP was ineffective
	in the team studied. While XP should ideally foster double-loop learning,
	triple-loop learning can explain why this does not necessarily occur.
	Research illustrates how power factors influence learning among groups
	of individuals; this study focuses on one specific power factor -
	the power inherent in the desire to conform. The Abilene Paradox
	describes how groups can make ineffective decisions that are contrary
	to that which group members personally desire or believe. Ineffective
	decision-making occurs due to the desire to conform among group members;
	this was shown as the cause of ineffective learning in the software
	team studied. This desire to conform originated in how the project
	team cohered as a group, which was, in turn, influenced by the social
	values embraced by XP. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses the proposed model of the collaborative virtual

	the ``Think-Pair-Share{''}. The main objective of this study is to
	design a model for an online learning system that facilitates the
	collaborative learning activities in a virtual environment such as
	online communications and pair or small group discussions. In order
	to model the virtual learning environment, the RUP methodology has
	been used where it involves the data collection phase and the analysis
	and design phase. Fifty respondents have been randomly selected to
	participate in the data collection phase to investigate the students'
	interest and learning styles as well as their learning preferences.
	The results have shown the needs for the development of online small
	group discussions that can be used as an alternative learning style
	for programming courses. The proposed design of the virtual learning
	system named as the Online Collaborative Learning System or OCLS
	is being depicted using the object-oriented models which are the
	use-case model and class diagram in order to show the concise processes
	of virtual ``Think-Pair-Share{''} collaborative activities. The ``Think-Pair-Share{''}
	collaborative learning technique that is being used in this model
	has been chosen because of its simplicity and relatively low-risk.
	This paper also presents the proposed model of the system's architecture
	that will become the guidelines for the physical development of OCLS
	using the web-based applications.},

	involves divergent selection, wherein the maladaptation of immigrants
	and hybrids impedes gene flow between ecological environments (i.e.
	ecological speciation). The other involves geographic features that
	limit dispersal. We determined the relative influence of these two
	processes in natural populations of Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia

	gene flow should be impeded by geographic distance and physical barriers.
	We examined how genetic divergence, long-term gene flow, and contemporary
	dispersal within a watershed were influenced by waterfalls, geographic
	distance, predation, and habitat features. We found that waterfalls
	and geographic distance increased genetic divergence and reduced
	dispersal and long-term gene flow. Differences in predation or habitat
	features did not influence genetic divergence or gene flow. In contrast,
	differences in predation did appear to reduce contemporary dispersal.

	have been used to structure and bring some order into software development
	processes. One of the most widely understood traditional methods
	is the waterfall life cycle model. Recently, agile development methods
	have emerged to overcome some of the process and product-related
	problems associated with traditional models. They are believed to
	be lightweight, people focused, adaptive and allow knowledge transfer.
	Researchers in the area of knowledge management claimed that the
	knowledge creation process software developers build towards a specific
	mode would lead to its adoption. This paper attempts to integrate
	knowledge creation as a condition of adoption. This paper reports
	on how a Canadian organization shifts its development method from
	the waterfall process to extreme programming model. The findings
	show that the differences outweigh the similarities and caution needs
	to be exercised in adopting either one of two models. Knowledge creation,
	indeed, plays an important role in adopting extreme programming model.
	The implications of these findings for both researchers and practitioners
	are discussed},

  abstract = {The RToolkit is an open source, cross platform object oriented distributed

	provides an infrastructure between low level RTI API and simulation

	both DoD 1.3 and IEEE 1516 HLA standards with a unified and simplified

	both standards without rewriting the source code. The RToolkit is
	FOM agile and can be easily customized for different FOMs. The framework
	is implemented in C++. Well known design patterns and object oriented
	programming paradigms are used during design and implementation.
	This paper describes the architectural foundations and functionality

	reusable design for developers to decrease efforts associated with
	federate and federation development and maintenance process, and
	to improve software quality through reuse. Virtually, The RToolkit

	issues raised by our work on the Haskell Refactorer. We briefly introduce
	the ideas behind refactoring, and a set of elementary functional
	refactorings. The core of the paper then outlines the main challenges
	that arise from our aim to produce practical tools for a decidedly
	non-toy language, summarizes our experience in trying to establish
	the necessary meta-programming infrastructure and gives an implementation

	for new product/process qualification and ramp, new tool qualification,
	tool/process monitoring, sharing of production and development tools,

	for ensuring that the fab can be powerful, agile, and flexible lies
	across many internal organizations. But the responsibility lies most
	directly with the product integration/route build team and the factory
	systems integrators/lead users. The product integration/route build
	teams are responsible for defining all factory entities that will
	be controlled or need to be monitored for fab control. The factory
	systems integrators/lead users must then configure their systems
	run the fab within this environment fully defined by the product

	fab ``model{''} cannot be too simple or generic to allow the factory
	systems to properly monitor the fab and take appropriate and timely
	action for efficient production. Conversely the fab ``model{''} cannot
	be so complex that defining product/process changes becomes so labor
	intensive and risk laden that it becomes the major cycle time contributor
	to new product/process introduction. These issues will be explained
	from the perspective of the dispatching system which uses a large
	spectrum of fab data to decide how the fab is run. The solutions
	that these teams use to solve the problems above have a direct effect

  abstract = {As business and technology environments change atan unpre-cedented
	rate, software development agility to respond to changing user requirements
	has become increasingly critical for software development performance.
	Agile software development approaches, which emphasize sense-and-respond,
	self-organization, cross-functional teams, and continuous adaptation,
	have been adopted by an increasing number of organizations to improve
	their software development agility. However, the agile development
	literature is largely anee-dotal and prescriptive, lacking empirical
	evidence and theoretical foundation to support the principles and
	practices of agile development. Little research has empirically examined
	the software development agility construct in terms of its dimensions,
	determinants, and effects on software development performance. As
	a result, there is a lack of understanding about how organizations
	can effectively implement an agile development approach. Using an
	integrated research approach that combines quantitative and qualitative
	data analyses, this research opens the black box of agile development
	by empirically examining the relationships among two dimensions of
	software development agility (software team response extensiveness
	and software team response efficiency), two antecedents that can
	be controlled (team autonomy and team diversity), and three aspects
	of software development performance (on-time completion, on-budget
	completion, and software functionality). Our PLS results of survey
	responses of 399 software project managers suggest that the relationships
	among these variables are more complex than what has been perceived
	by the literature. The results suggest a tradeoff relationship between
	response extensiveness and response efficiency. These two agility
	dimensions impact software development performance differently: response
	efficiency positively affects all of on-time completion, on-budget
	completion, and software functionality, whereas response extensiveness
	positively affects only software functionality. The results also
	suggest that team autonomy has a positive effect on response efficiency
	and a negative effect on response extensiveness, and that team diversity
	has a positive effect on response extensiveness. We conducted 10
	post hoc case studies to qualitatively crossvalidate our PLS results
	and provide rich, additional insights regarding the complex, dynamic
	interplays between autonomy, diversity, agility, and performance.
	The qualitative analysis also provides explanations for both supported
	and unsupported hypotheses. We discuss these qualitative analysis
	results and conclude with the theoretical and practical implications
	of our research findings for agile development approaches.},

	affordable, high-quality, energy-efficient(EE) BASs, but also to
	take advantage of high level abstractions, efficient special-purpose
	verification algorithms and analysis tools for early validation and

	products. We are watching to the rise of Model-Driven Development
	as the pragmatic approach to build them, since this approach is based
	on the notion of explicit abstractions/models. This is achieved thanks
	to model transformations that, besides automatically translating
	any specification of a given language into other execution specifications,
	also allow us to derive analysis specifications. The problem with
	the referred types of transformation purposes is that we cannot guarantee
	quality and coherence between the derived specifications into execution
	specifications and combine it with analysis specifications unless
	we can either make use of testing over the execution, with the problems
	already known, or have mechanisms to study the transformations. While
	this problem is motivated by the concrete need of developing BASs,

	how to guarantee the correctness and appropriateness of system composition

	of equipping the co-engineering process with a formal semantics.
	The core problem of establishing such a theory is to give a formal
	semantics to an open knowledge source. We have found a suitable tool

  abstract = {Proponents of Agile development processes claim that adhering to Agile
	principles leads to the delivery of high quality code in evolutionary

	the use of unit test suites, entrusted to catch regressions as soon
	as they occur. Consequently, the system can only be as trustworthy
	as its tests, meaning that measurements of the testsE quality is
	crucial. Whilst mutation testing has been proposed as a means of
	uncovering test suite defects, it has not been widely adopted in
	the industry; mainly due to its computational expense and manual
	effort required by developers investigating unkilled mutants. To
	make mutation testing affordable, we propose incremental mutation
	testing - a variation of mutation testing which leverages the iterative
	nature of agile development by limiting the scope of mutant generation
	to sections of code which have changed since the last mutation run.
	Preliminary results show that the number of mutants generated is
	drastically reduced along with the time required to generate mutants

	many of those methods have limitations in terms of the types of projecis
	they could support. In parallel, there is mounting evidence that
	creating a method that is optimum for every software project is unattainable
	and impractical, In this paper, we propose not the selection or the
	adoption of a single agile method but the adoption and diffusion
	of a well established and recognized method flamework in which an
	organizational methodology is constructed from method fragments using
	the concepts of method engineering. This paper briefly reports on
	a case study of introducing method engineering using the OPEN process
	framework to construct an agile method for a multi-national legal
	publishing company who realized the need for a flexible and customizable
	method for their many projects.},

  abstract = {Various agile software development methodologies, practices, and techniques
	have been proposed in the last decade, some present novel ideas,
	while many are simply made up of tasks and techniques borrowed from
	prominent agile methodologies. Each of these methodologies prescribes
	a set of practices and techniques which are deemed appropriate for
	application in a specific context. However, there exists no single
	method which fits all project situations. This has resulted in the
	advent of Situational Method Engineering (SME) approaches, which
	are used for developing software methodologies that are tailored
	to fit the specific circumstances of the project situation at hand.
	Since tool support has become an essential prerequisite for widespread
	adoption of software engineering methods, provision of Computer-Aided
	Method Engineering (CAME) tools has become a priority. We provide
	a basis for the application of assembly-based situational method
	engineering to the development of bespoke agile methodologies. To
	this aim, a comprehensive set of relevant methodology features has
	first been identified, spanning the range of possible requirements
	that a method engineer may define for the agile methodology under
	development. Based on this set of requirements, a method base has
	been proposed that contains the method chunks necessary for satisfying
	these requirements. The proposed method base conforms to the Software
	Process Engineering Metamodel (SPEM 2.0), and can be immediately
	plugged into CAME tools which implement this metamodel, including
	the Eclipse Process Framework Composer (EPFC).},

  abstract = {Transforming the current National Airspace System (NAS) is required
	due to the spectacular growth of air traffic and the demand for new
	types of services by users of the system. The Federal Aviation Administration
	(FAA) is developing and modernizing individual Air Traffic Management
	(ATM) systems using modern technologies, software development methods
	and system architectures that would fundamentally change ATM operations.
	However, transformation of the NAS to achieve System Wide Information
	Management (SWIM) represents one of the most challenging arenas of
	Information Technology (IT). The virtues of a Service Oriented Architecture
	(SOA) offer a practical framework for success by transforming the
	components of the NAS into services that can be reused and combined.
	Using a SOA enables the transformation of the NAS to be evolutionary,
	agile and sufficiently flexible to adapt to changing business dynamics.
	This paper describes the use of a Business (Mission) Driven Development
	(BDD) methodology in the context of a SOA to address the significant
	and complex issues of transforming the NAS. Use of a BDD methodology
	is a key enabler for managing the scope and fidelity of decision
	making for system and software design. This methodology uses business
	value to balance the many competing concerns inherent in developing
	complex systems. Using a BDD methodology enables reusability and
	flexibility while navigating the roadmap for NAS system-wide information
	management evolution.},

	manipulating and rapidly prototyping language descriptions, tools
	and applications. TXL is designed to allow explicit programmer control
	over the interpretation, application, order and backtracking of both
	parsing and rewriting rules. Using first order functional programming
	at the higher level and term rewriting at the lower level, TXL provides
	for flexible programming of traversals, strategies, guards, scope
	of application and parameterized context. This flexibility has allowed
	TXL users to express and experiment with both new ideas in parsing,
	such as robust, island and agile parsing, and new paradigms in rewriting,
	such as XML markup, rewriting strategies and contextualized rules,
	without any change to TXL itself. In this paper I outline the history,
	evolution and concepts of TXL with emphasis on what makes it different
	from other language manipulation tools, and give examples of its
	use in expressing and applying recent new paradigms in language processing.

  abstract = {TYPHOON is a capability-aware peer-to-peer (P2P) system. It exploits
	the heterogeneity of nodes in the system based on the concept of
	virtual homes. Nodes participating in the system are classified as
	good and inactive. TYPHOON uses resources provided by good peers.
	It is thus more reliable and agile than a naive structured P2P system.
	When a good peer is overloaded, it picks a suitable inactive node
	and migrates some loads (i.e., virtual homes) to that node. However,
	migration of virtual homes may cause instability in the system. TYPHOON
	thus incorporates a mechanism for tracking virtual homes. A migrated
	home can receive states of relevant homes using an adaptive, logical
	tree structure that can also react to system heterogeneity, node
	loading and network locality. A migrated home can also proactively
	discover the state of an interested home to ensure the correctness
	of lookup. We evaluate TYPHOON using theoretical and simulation analysis.
	We also benchmark TYPHOON using a prototype system on 34 desktop
	PCs. The results all confirm the effectiveness of TYPHOON. © 2004

  abstract = {As the Army transforms into a more lethal, lighter and agile force,
	the technologies that support these systems must decrease in size
	while increasing in intelligence. Micro-electromechanical systems
	(MEMS) are one such technology that the Army and DOD will rely on
	heavily to accomplish these objectives. Conditions for utilization
	of MEMS by the military are unique. Operational and storage environments
	for the military are significantly different than those found in
	the commercial sector. Issues unique to the military include; high
	G-forces during gun launch, extreme temperature and humidity ranges,
	extended periods of inactivity (20 years plus) and interaction with
	explosives and propellants. The military operational environments
	in which MEMS will be stored or required to function are extreme
	and far surpass any commercial operating conditions. Security and
	encryption are a must for all MEMS communication, tracking, or data
	reporting devices employed by the military. Current and future military
	applications of MEMS devices include safety and arming devices, fuzing
	devices, various guidance systems, sensors/detectors, inertial measurement
	units, tracking devices, radio frequency devices, wireless Radio
	Frequency Identifications (RFIDs) and network systems, GPS's, radar
	systems, mobile base systems and information technology. MEMS embedded
	into these weapons systems will provide the military with new levels
	of speed, awareness, lethality, and information dissemination. The
	system capabilities enhanced by MEMS will translate directly into
	tactical and strategic military advantages. While reliance on MEMS
	devices has been increasing, limited studies have been performed
	to assess their reliability and identify failure mechanisms. Accordingly,
	the US Army Corrosion Office at Picatinny, NJ has initiated the ``Storage
	& Quality Requirements for Military MEMS{''} as part of their MEMS
	Reliability Assessment Program to address these issues. The goals
	of the MEMS Reliability Assessment Program are to: 1) establish the
	reliability of MEMS devices including the impact of transportation,
	long term storage, operating environment, packaging & interconnection
	issues, 2) analyze the compatibility of MEMS devices with energetic
	and other hazardous materials found in military items, 3) identify
	failure mechanisms and failure rates, 4) develop accelerated test
	protocols for assessing the reliability of MEMS, S) develop reliability
	models for these devices, 6) identify a standardizing body, standard
	terminology, definitions, and categories for MEMS devices and 7)
	determine potential test methodologies for assessing these mechanisms.
	Current ongoing efforts in support of the program include: 1) an
	assessment of the long-term storage performance and standards requirements,
	2) initiation of ESS testing for the identification of failure mechanisms
	of selected devices, 3) drafting of a joint test protocol for assessment
	of the corrosion potential of MEMS devices, 4) assessment of applicability
	of reliability software packages for use with MEMS devices and 5)
	development of test guidelines for the assessment of MEMS reliability.
	This program will benefit the MEMS user community by filling the
	information gap that currently exists for reliability, including:
	Assessment of the operational environments in which the military
	MEMS device may be utilized Determining & developing methods to preserve
	MEMS devices during long term storage before they are designed into
	products Independent assessment of reliability that cannot be obtained
	from private industry Establishment of reliability data that will
	be fed back into development & design to improve MEMS devices Production
	& design process can be vastly improved increasing yields that will
	drive costs down With the rapid growth of the MEMS industry and the
	potential for MEMS utilization in advanced weapon systems, it is
	crucial to consider the reliability of this emerging technology in
	the early stages of development.},

  abstract = {The use of agile principles and practices in software development
	is becoming a powerful force in today's workplace. In our quest to
	develop better products, therefore, it is imperative that we strive
	to learn and understand the application of agile methods, principles
	and techniques to the software development enterprise. Unfortunately,
	in many educational institutions, courses and projects that emphasize
	agile software development are minimal. At best, students have only
	limited exposure to the agile philosophy, principles and practices
	at the graduate and undergraduate levels of education. In an effort
	to address this concern, we offered an advanced graduate-level course
	entitled ``Agile Software Engineering{''} in the Department of Computer
	Science at Virginia Tech. The primary objectives of the course were
	to introduce the values, principles and practices underlying the
	agile philosophy, and to do so in an atmosphere that encour-ages
	debate and critical thinking. The course was designed around three
	central components: (1) teaching the essentials of how one develops
	a product within an agile framework, (2) having invited talks by
	notable industry experts, and (3) having students present and discuss
	current agile research topics and issues. This paper describes our
	experiences during the offering of that course, and in particular,
	the unique perspectives of the class instructor, the teaching assistant
	and a student who was enrolled in the course. © 2012 ACM.},

  year = {2010},
  pages = {28-32},
  note = {cited By (since 1996) 0},
  abstract = {Instituting digital asset management (DAM) in cultural heritage institutions
	tends to be a major IT initiative. What is often overlooked is that
	DAM in isolation merely provides a resource intensive organizational
	tool for digital assets within the institution. The more important
	aspects of a DAM implementation are the workflow processes and procedures
	that are integrated into the application, the links the application
	makes internally and externally to other institutional systems, and
	ultimately how the implementation changes and enhances the institution's
	business processes surrounding the use of digital assets. When the
	Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, decided to undertake a
	DAM implementation as part of their revamped digital imaging program,
	their final solution combined MediaBin, an enterprise-level DAM product
	from Autonomy, with data links to their collection management system,
	AdLib, and Microsoft SharePoint, a collaboration and business process
	portal toolkit, with an eye toward further integration in the future.
	I was commissioned as an outside consultant to help the Rijksmuseum
	Archive conceptualize their internal business workflows and processes
	involving digital assets; as they existed and how they might change
	and be enhanced. Working with the ICT Director, Rob Hendriks, we
	evaluated systems to layer the actual tasks of these workflows and
	processes on top of the chosen DAM software. The choice of the DAM
	application was influenced by its ability to connect to possible
	front ends, SharePoint being only one of the choices evaluated. The
	museum had prior experience working with SharePoint making its choice
	a logical decision. The integration that resulted has been in use
	for about two years, with additional functionality added in subsequent
	versions. It has allowed the museum to be more efficient and consider
	new opportunities. Training of users was fast-tracked; most users
	never see the MediaBin interface which can be confusing for non-imaging
	personnel. Users interact with a simplified SharePoint interface,
	trimmed down to basic functionality. SharePoint also serves as the
	enabler for request forms, project tracking, and order fulfillment.
	The model we will describe in our presentation is in many ways an
	evolution of DAM ahead of the actual maturation of DAM applications,
	especially for the cultural heritage sector. In the future, a traditional
	DAM application could be best of breed components rather than an
	integrated system; a file system or repository like Fedora, a metadata
	container or wrapper within a database, and a digital asset transformation
	engine like ImageMagick. Interfaces and workflows to suit the audience
	would be layered on top via products like SharePoint or open source
	wiki or CMS systems. The key differentiator for each institution
	would be the business processes and workflows that make the integration
	truly functional for the organization, and the flexibility to plug
	in other systems which feed data to, or need access from asset records.
	What we have accomplished in a still somewhat traditional manner
	could be pushed toward a more deconstructed, open and agile development
	environment.},

	of information systems (IS), namely, agile IS, has emerged. Agile
	IS, defined as information systems developed using agile methods,
	are characterized by frequent upgrades with a small number of new
	features released periodically. The existing research on agile IS
	has mainly focused on the developers' perspective with little research
	into end users' responses to these agile IS. Drawing upon the tripartite
	model of attitude, the status quo and the omission bias theories,
	and the availability heuristic, we propose a model that utilizes
	constructs from the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology,
	the IS continuance model, habit, and individual differences to examine
	the drivers of user acceptance of agile IS. Further, we investigate
	not only users' intentions to continue using the agile IS but also
	their intentions to use new features when they are released, which
	is a surrogate for the ultimate success of agile IS. Data from 477
	users of an agile IS showed that users' level of comfort with constant
	changes, the facilitating conditions provided, and users' habit are
	predictors of both types of intentions, with users' level of comfort
	with constant changes being the strongest predictor. Users' intentions
	to continue using agile IS are also determined by users' satisfaction
	with and perceived usefulness of the past upgrades. Finally, users
	who are innovative are more likely to use future releases of new
	features. The present work fills a gap in the software engineering
	literature and contributes a technology acceptance model specific
	to agile IS, which are becoming a mainstay of companies' IT portfolio
	in a fast-changing business environment.},

	in a safe, effective and socially productive way at the interface

	that are essential in ensuring improved health and social outcomes
	are person-centeredness, comprehensiveness and integration and continuity
	of care, with a regular entry into the health system, so that it
	becomes possible to build an enduring relationship of trust between
	patients and their healthcare providers. The adoption of a successful
	primary care system premises active participation of users who are
	familiar with the cooperative and collaborative nature of healthcare
	delivery. Thus, there is a need for reusable, flexible, agile and
	adaptable training content with the objective to enable healthcare
	professionals instill their knowledge and expertise in primary care
	processes. To this end, social software, such as a wiki, could be
	used as it supports cooperation and collaboration anytime, anywhere,
	combined with semantic web technology that enables structuring pieces

	should act as a collective online memory containing training material

  abstract = {Object-oriented software design is a kind of black-art that requires
	a combination of common sense, experience, good taste and the capability
	to look at a problem from different points of view. According to
	our experience, these abilities cannot be easily transferred to the
	students in a lecture. Taking ideas from the way software is designed
	in industry, according to agile methodologies, we have tried a more
	active teaching approach using role-play. Students are faced with
	a design problem and provided with an initial sketchy design, i.e.
	a number of classes, and several use cases to be solved using those
	classes. Each student adopts the role of an object and each use case
	is executed through message passing between the objects represented
	by the students. This way, the students have the chance to, at their
	own pace, evaluate the consequences of a given design and test their
	ideas with the other actors in play. The good results obtained during
	the empirical evaluation of this active learning approach have motivated
	us to transfer our teaching methodology to virtual environments.
	Using our previous experience developing game-based learning environments
	and taking ingredients from the interface and gameplay of first-person
	shooters and sport games, we have designed a role-play virtual environment
	(RPVE) that intends to maintain, and even reinforce, the benefits
	of role-play in the classroom. We developed ViRPlay3D, a RPVE to
	understand object-oriented software behavior. It supported a single
	player, included a simple metaphor and did not allow the modification
	of CRC cards. Nowadays, we have completed the specifications of ViRPlay3D2,
	an extension of ViRPlay3D for, both, understanding and creating object-oriented
	designs. ViRPlay3D2 is a multiplayer environment where students mimic
	the classroom role-play sessions. The students are immersed in the
	environment using a first-person view that simulates the point of
	view of the objects that participate in the role-play. The students
	can modify the proposed design and the simulation is recorded for
	a further evaluation.},

	about the appropriate design of proIcesses for making software. Partisans
	in both research and practice argue for and against plan-based (allegedly
	inflexible) and agile (allegedly too flexible) approaches. The stakes
	in this debate are high; questions raised about plan-based approaches
	undermine longstanding claims that those approaches, when realized,
	represent maturity of practice. In this commentary, we call for research
	programs that will move beyond partisan disagreement to a more nuanced
	discussion, one that takes into account both benefits and costs of
	flexibility. Key to such programs will be the development of a robust
	contingency framework for deciding when (in what conditions) plan-based
	and agile methods should be used. We develop a basic contingency
	framework in this paper, one that models the benefit/cost economics
	described in narratives about the transition from craft to industrial
	production of physical products. We use this framework to demonstrate
	the power of even a simple model to help us accomplish three objectives:
	(1) to refocus discussions about the appropriate design of software
	development processes, concentrating on when to use particular approaches
	and how they might be usefully combined; (2) to suggest and guide
	a trajectory of research that can support and enrich this discussion;
	and (3) to suggest a technology-based explanation for the emergence
	of agile development at this point in history. Although we are not
	the first to argue in favor of a contingency perspective, we show
	that there remain many opportunities for information systems (IS)
	research to have a major impact on practice in this area. © 2009

  abstract = {The ability to build lean and agile supply chains has not developed
	as rapidly as anticipated, because the development of technology
	to manage such concepts of lean/agile for integrated supply chains
	is still under way. Also, due to ill-defined and vague indicators,
	which exist within leanness/agility assessment, many measures are
	described subjectively by linguistic terms, which are characterized
	by vagueness and multi-possibility, and the conventional assessment
	approaches cannot suitably or effectively handle such dynamic situations.
	In this paper, we propose a novel approach to model agility (which
	includes leanness) and introduce dynamic agility level index (DALi)
	through fuzzy intelligent agents. Generally, it is difficult to emulate
	human decision making if the recommendations of the agents are provided
	as crisp, numerical values. The multiple intelligent agents used
	in this study communicate their recommendation as fuzzy numbers to
	accommodate ambiguity in the opinion and the data used for modelling
	agility attributes for integrated supply chains. Moreover, when agents
	operate based on different criteria pertaining to agility like flexibility,
	profitability, quality, innovativeness, pro-activity, speed of response,
	cost, robustness, etc., for integrated supply chains, the ranking
	and aggregation of these fuzzy opinions to arrive at a consensus
	is complex. The proposed fuzzy intelligent agents approach provides
	a unique and unprecedented attempt to determine consensus in these
	fuzzy opinions and effectively model dynamic agility. The efficacy
	of the proposed approach is demonstrated with the help of an illustrative
	example.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to characterize, analyze, and
	demonstrate machine-understandable semantic process for validating,
	integrating, and processing technical design information. This establishes
	both a vision and tools for information reuse and semi-automatic
	processing in engineering design projects, including virtual machine
	laboratory applications with generated components. Design/methodology/approach:
	The process model has been developed iteratively in terms of action
	research, constrained by the existing technical design practices
	and assumptions (design documents, expert feedback), available technologies
	(pre-studies and experiments with scripting and pipeline tools),
	benchmarking with other process models and methods (notably the RUP
	and DITA), and formal requirements (computability and the critical
	information paths for the generated applications). In practice, the
	work includes both quantitative and qualitative components. Findings:
	Technical design processes may be greatly enhanced in terms of semantic
	process thinking, by enriching design information, and automating
	information validation and transformation tasks. Contemporary design
	information, however, is mainly intended for human consumption, and
	needs to be explicitly enriched with the currently missing data and
	interfaces. In practice, this may require acknowledging the role
	of technical information or knowledge engineer, to lead the development
	of the semantic design information process in a design organization.
	There is also a trade-off between machine-readability and system
	complexity that needs to be studied further, both empirically and
	in theory. Research limitations/implications: The conceptualization
	of the semantic process is essentially an abstraction based on the
	idea of progressive design. While this effectively allows implementing
	semantic processes with, e.g., pipeline technologies, the abstraction
	is valid only when technical design is organized into reasonably
	distinct tasks. Practical implications: Our work points out a best
	practice for technical information management in progressive design
	that can be applied on different levels. Social implications: Current
	design processes may be somewhat impaired by legacy practices that
	do not promote information reuse and collaboration beyond conventional
	task domains. Our work provides a reference model to analyze and
	develop design activities as formalized work-flows. This work should
	lead into improved industry design process models and novel CAD/CAM/PDM
	applications, thereby strengthening industry design processes. Originality/value:
	While extensively studied, semantic modeling in technical design
	has been largely dominated by the idea of capturing design artifacts
	without a clear rationale why this is done and what level of detail
	should be favored in models. In the semantic process presented in
	this article, the utility and the chief quality criteria of semantic
	models (of technical information and artifacts) are explicitly established
	by the semantic processing pipeline(s). This constructively explains
	the significance of semantic models as communication and information
	requirement interfaces, with concrete use cases.},

	While such a paradigm shift promises to better support the timely

	a theoretical basis to empirically evaluate the actual support of
	Scrum in concrete scenarios. The introduced framework is based on
	the extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which has been proven
	to be also applicable to describe the intention of developers to
	use a methodology. Building upon results from qualitative in-depth
	interviews with six experienced Scrum experts of a German DAX-30

  abstract = {Student project teams are an integral part of the software engineering
	curriculum. This paper reports on the classroom experiences of student
	teams developing Android applications using Scrum. The course in
	study is a software engineering undergraduate elective in Agile Software
	Development which used Android mobile phones donated by Google as
	the development environment for student teams to learn and practice
	Scrum. Scrum is an agile project management framework increasingly
	being adopted in the development of commercial software products.
	When used in an academic setting it provides the opportunity to introduce
	and practice project management skills involving planning, estimation,
	tracking and identifying opportunities for continuous process improvement.
	As the ideal number of team members on a Scrum project is 5-9 developers,
	Scrum maps well from a size perspective for the typical student team
	collaborating on a course or capstone project. While Scrum has specific
	project roles and ceremonies, it is intentionally non-prescriptive
	on the development practices to be used in the execution of the project.
	In a software development project these practices are realized in
	the familiar software engineering life-cycles activities of requirements-analysis-design-code-testdeploy.
	In an Agile process these activities occur in more tightly wound
	incremental and iterative time boxes. Agile has also introduced variations
	on existing software development practices such as test first design
	or the frontloading of testing activities early in the development
	life-cycle. The paper addresses the benefits and limitations of the
	adoption of Scrum by a student project team and proposes recommendations
	for a pragmatic process framework - the Student Scrum - based on
	the contributions of agile processes and practices. © 2011 American

	First, both emphasize a ``learn by doing{''} approach consistent

	through a variety of activities. We believe the latter point is especially
	important; in our view entrepreneurship is often promoted through
	a single highly visible activity. Our approach embeds entrepreneurship
	across the spectrum of student engagement. This reflects our belief
	that students must engage repeatedly with entrepreneurs to understand
