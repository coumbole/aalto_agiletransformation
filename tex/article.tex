\section{Introduction}

As the competition in software industry is growing companies are constantly
looking to improve their effectiveness. Agile methods are claimed to increase
productivity and quality \cite{Livermore2008}, which makes them attractive for
companies pursuing better performance. However, large organizations may have
problems introducing agile methods \cite{Dyba2009}. As agile methods are
initially designed for small teams their application has proven to be
problematic in a larger scale \cite{Boehm2005}.

It is typical for large companies to function according to traditional software
engineering models [Cite?!] (also why?). These models strive for consistent quality and performance
by rigorous planning and definition of process. This kind of approach is however
badly suited for software development, as projects typically encounter
situations that are too hard or impossible to foretell \cite{Schwaber2002}.
The main problems in plan-driven development are the high cost of changes and
late feedback on quality \cite{Petersen2010}. Long release cycles, cost of
resopnding to change and distance from customers undermine the  competitiveness
of companies. Agile methods are believed to bring remedy to these problems.

The goal of this research is to explore how and why large organizations adopt
agile methods. Studies on large scale agile transformations have been published,
but no extensive and summarizing research is available on the subject. In this
research we will give an overview of reported case studies on adopting agile
methods in large organizations. We will further discuss the motivations for
adopting agile methods, the characteristics of agile transformations, and
factors relating to success or challenge in the transformation process. Our
research is focused on the process of organizational change. We leave out topics
related to comparing the initial and transformed states of organisations, such
as measuring the performance of organizations before and after the
transformation.

This paper is organized as follows. The next section gives an overview of large
scale agile development. Section \ref{sec:method} presents the literature review
method used for conducting the research. The findings of the review are
discussed in section \ref{sec:results}, and section \ref{sec:conclusions}
discusses the findings and gives proposals for future research.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

Introducing agile menthods in large organizations is more difficult than it is
in small organizations \cite{Livermore2008, Dyba2008}. Agile methods are not
founded on the use of individual tools or practices, but rather on a holistic
change in the ways of thinking. Adopting agile requires often change of the
entire organizational culture \cite{Misra2010}.

One significant difference between small and large adoptions is that large
organizations have more dependencies between projects and teams. This increases
the need for formal documentation and thus reduces agility \cite{Lindvall2004}.
In addition to inter-team coordination large organizations require development
teams to interact with other organizational units, which are often non-agile of
their nature. For instance, HR may demand individuals to have strictly specified
roles in projects \cite{Boehm2005}, or a change control board may inhibit use of
continuous integration or refactoring \cite{Lindvall2004}. All units affected by
the agile transformation need to be informed and heard, and the agile process
must be adjusted according to their needs \cite{Lindvall2004, Cohn2003,
Boehm2005}.

Agile methods will also affect management and business related functions. A key
factor is that management should move away from life cycle models and towards
iterative and feature centric models \cite{Nerur2005}. Management must shift
their focus from a large scale scope to short term project planning
\cite{Misra2010}, as agile methods emphasize that meaningful planning can only
be done for the near future \cite{Boehm2005}.

\section{Research method}
\label{sec:method}

% Research questions:
%
% What are the motivations for starting an organizational transformation?
%
% What kind of agile transformations have been reported?
%
% What were challenges and success factors in the transformation process?


The literature review was conducted as an application of Kitchenham's
method for systematic literature review (SLR) \cite{Kitchenham2007}. The method
was applied to be performed by only one researcher, and to serve as a
preliminary work evaluating the feasibility of a more in-depth review. The
required effort was limited by selecting only the following subset of SLR steps:
identification of primary sources, data extraction and synthesis. Steps left out
were the development of a systematic review protocol, strict study quality
assessment, and reviews in the study selection process.

\subsection{Data sources and search strategy}

The searches for primary sources was conducted in two steps. First a preliminary
search was made to sample the existing literature. Then a systematic search was
done based on the preliminary search. The following databases were included in
the searches: IEEExplore\footnote{http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/},
ACM\footnote{http://dl.acm.org/}, Scopus\footnote{http://www.scopus.com/},
ProQuest\footnote{http://search.proquest.com/}.
Additionally the archive of International XP
Conference\footnote{http://link.springer.com/} was searched.

The search phrases used in the preliminary search were \textit{agile
transformation} and \textit{large scale agile}. For the systematic search three
facets and appropriate keywords were chosen, as presented in Table
\ref{table:searchterms}. To search the databases a query phrase was constructed
by joining the keywords of each facet by \texttt{OR} operators and the facets by
\texttt{AND} operators.

As the preliminary search omitted some of the keywords in Table
\ref{table:searchterms} it yielded a small number of additional matches. The
reason for variance in matches was that many articles had creative titles or the
abstracts and keywords were not informative enough. Because of this, the search
with more restrictive keywords was unable to capture all possible matches.
We are however confident that the search covered the majority of material
relating to agile transformations in large organizations. If a wider search
should be performed, our recommendation is to only regard the facets
\textit{agile methods} and \textit{organizational change}. This would lead to
significantly more matches in the first stage of selecting studies, but the
additional effort is necessary due to the limitations of a keyword search.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{ p{4cm} l }
        \toprule
        Facet                  & Keywords   \\ \midrule
        Agile methods          & agile, scrum, lean, xp \\ 
        Organizational change  & transformation, transition, change, migration \\
        Large organization     & enterprise, organization, (large \texttt{AND} scale) \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Facets and related search terms used}
    \label{table:searchterms}
\end{table}

The selection process of the primary studies is summarized in Figure
\ref{fig:selection_process}. The database search yielded 1603 matches from which
100 sources were chosen by the title. 17 unmatched sources from the preliminary
search were also included. Finally, 31 sources were selected based on the
abstract to be included for data extraction. One source was not available, which
reduced the final number of primary studies to 30.

    \caption{Process of selecting primary studies}
    \label{fig:selection_process}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Inclusion criteria}

The 30 primary sources were selected by four criteria: study type, size of
organization, use of agile methods in software development, and viewpoint on
transformation. Firstly, only case studies and experience reports on agile
software development were included in this study. Papers discussing agile
methods or organizational transformation on as a general topic were left out.
Secondly, the size of the organization described in the included primary studies
was to be large enough to show the challenges of large scale agile development
\cite{Lindvall2004}. Further, only studies discussing agile software development
were included, leaving out for instance studies on agile management. Finally, to
be included each study had to provide a viewpoint on the organizational
transformation.

\subsection{Data extraction}

The data extraction was performed using the data extraction form presented in
Table \ref{table:dataform}. -- Joku pointti lisää

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

-- Research on large scale agile transformations has been published.

-- Papers presenting the effect of agile on specific areas in software
development exist, but the whole has not been studied as much.

\subsection{Limitations}

-- The papers are mostly experience reports with no research method.

-- Some papers were of low quality, but they were included in order to give a
view of the topic that is broader and inclined towards practice.

-- Effect of organizational change is hard (or maybe impossible?) to measure
(kuulemma Marjo ja Kristian tietävät asiasta).

\subsection{Future research}

-- Very little studies on quantitative comparison of before/after transformation
has been done. (how about quantitative?)

-- What thihgs are important to report in an agile transformation case study?

-- Do not focus exclusively on the software perspective, but find parallels from
general research on organizaional transformation and leadership. (Tähän pitäs
vissiin sitte olla joku konkreettinen ehdotus?)
