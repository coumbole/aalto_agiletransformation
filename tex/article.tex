\section{Introduction}

As the competition in software industry is growing companies are constantly
looking to improve their effectiveness. Agile methods are claimed to increase
productivity and quality \cite{Livermore2008}, which makes them attractive for
companies pursuing better performance. However, large organizations may have
problems introducing agile methods \cite{Dyba2009}. As agile methods are
initially designed for small teams their application has proven to be
problematic in a larger scale \cite{Boehm2005}.

It is typical for large companies to function according to traditional software
engineering models [Cite?!] (also why?). These models strive for consistent quality and performance
by rigorous planning and definition of process. This kind of approach is however
badly suited for software development, as projects typically encounter
situations that are too hard or impossible to foretell \cite{Schwaber2002}.
The main problems in plan-driven development are the high cost of changes and
late feedback on quality \cite{Petersen2010}. Long release cycles, cost of
resopnding to change and distance from customers undermine the  competitiveness
of companies. Agile methods are believed to bring remedy to these problems.

The motivation for this research is to cover a research gap we have identified,
relating to the adoption of agile methods in large organization. Studies on
large scale agile transformations have been published, but no extensive
seconodary research is available on the subject. The goal of this research is to
give an overview of reported case studies on adopting agile methods in large
organizations. We will further discuss the motivations for adopting agile
methods, the characteristics of agile transformations, and factors relating to
success or challenge in the transformation process.

This paper is organized as follows. The next section gives an overview of large
scale agile development. Section \ref{sec:method} presents the systematic
literature review method used for conducting the research. The findings of the
review are discussed in section \ref{sec:results}, and section
\ref{sec:conclusions} discusses the findings and gives proposals for future
research.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

-- Research on large scale agile transformations has been published.

-- Papers presenting the effect of agile on specific areas in software
development exist, but the whole has not been studied as much.

\subsection{Limitations}

-- The papers are mostly experience reports with no research method.

-- Some papers were of low quality, but they were included in order to give a
view of the topic that is broader and inclined towards practice.

-- Effect of organizational change is hard (or maybe impossible?) to measure
(kuulemma Marjo ja Kristian tietävät asiasta).

\subsection{Future research}

-- Very little studies on quantitative comparison of before/after transformation
has been done. (how about quantitative?)

-- What thihgs are important to report in an agile transformation case study?

-- Do not focus exclusively on the software perspective, but find parallels from
general research on organizaional transformation and leadership. (Tähän pitäs
vissiin sitte olla joku konkreettinen ehdotus?)
