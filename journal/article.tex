\begin{abstract}

Agile methods have become an appealing alternative for companies striving to
improve their performance, but the methods are originally designed for small and
individual teams. This poses challenges when introducing agile to large
organizations where development teams can not be autonomous. We reviewed 30
experience reports and case studies describing the process of taking agile
methods into use in large organizations. The primary motive for agile adoption
is the need to improve performance. For a successful transformation the entire
organization must be aligned and all organizational units must participate.
Creating an agile community in the organization will help the change to stick.
Typical problems are misunderstanding of the agile model, and difficulties
coordinating multiple agile teams.

--> Introductory paragraph

--> Motivation for research
-- There are no systematic reviews for this
-- A collection of experience reports can be used for creating a theoretical
   base.
--> There is interest in large scale [ref XP13 workshop]

--> Freudenberg, S. and Sharp, H., "The Top 10 Burning Research Questions from
    Practitioners," IEEE Software, pp. 8-9, 2010.

--> Why is large scale software development different from smaller scale?

--> This literature review is intended for researchers as a theroretical
   and proven foundation for the real problems that organizations face in
   transformations.
   This is also intended to be directly usable by practicioners, to serve as a
   base of general advice with strong motivation (although every organization
   has unique needs).

\section{Research method}
\label{sec:method}

The goal of the research was to aggregate evidence on how large organizations
transform into an agile way of working. The research was conducted as a
systematic litterature review based on empirical studies.

\subsection{Research questions}

The following research questions were set to guide the research process.

\begin{itemize}

\item
RQ1: Why do large organizations initiate an agile transformation?

\item
RQ2: How do large scale agile transformations usually proceed; do
     transformations exhibit patterns?

\item
RQ3: What are typical successes and challenges in a large scale agile
     transformation process?

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Definition of large scale}
\label{sec:largescale}

A key question in the study was the definition of \emph{large scale}. Large
scale requires additional coordination and makes communication difficult
compared to software development in small teams.

--> Needs to have complexity in software design?? --> What is complexity in software?
    Is ``complexity'' an issue in agile?
    What will bring complexity into software? Not costs or the length of the
    schedule. --> Having many people will bring the complexity in terms of the
    SDM to use.
--> Some people see cost as a definition for large scale, some see code base
    size [Petersen], some see project duration [Bjarnson?]. These are all
    related, but do not relate to any specific problem. You can spend X amount
    of money, but it does not in itself make any difference if the money is
    spent in an agile way.
--> Formal definitions (EU, etc.) look at project costs or company turnover.
    These definitions do not take a standpoint on complexity of the product, so
    they do not matter in the context of SDMs.

--> Ref: the XP conference
--> [Cockburn 2003] Agile is best suitable for teams around 50 people or fewer.
--> Boehm, B. and Turner, R., Balancing Agility and Discipline: A Guide for the
    Perplexed: Addison-Wesley, 2003. --> There might be a 50 person boundary?
    --> See Boehm also for list of 

--> The company must already be with N teams or N people, not growing up to the
    required numbers. Small companies in growth are therefore excluded. 


\subsection{Research process}

The research was conducted as an application of Kitchenham's
\cite{Kitchenham2007} guidelines for systematic literature review. The selection
of primary studies was done as a keyword based database search and manual
filtering of included studies. The filtering process was executed independently
by two researchers (Dikert, Paasivaara). The selected primary studies were coded
for data extraction and analysis. The entire process was audited and mentored by
a third researcher (Lassenius).

We deviated from Kitchenham's guideline on the part of data extraction. Instead
of using data extraction forms we analyzed the primary studies by coding. This
deviation was made in order to minimize how possible preconceptions would affect
the data extraction step, and to use a specialized software tool that allowed us
to record evidence in as much detail as possible.
% --> Possibility to find many different viewpoinits for the research questions
% --> Lots of items, which would have lead to much diversity in data extraction form 

\subsubsection{Inclusion criteria}
\label{sec:inclusioncriteria}

Based on the research questions and intended focus of the research, we defined
three facets to guide inclusion/exclusion decisions: agile software engineering,
focus on transformation, and large scale. The first facet covers primary studies
focusing on software engineering organizations applying or striving to apply
agile methods. The second facet states that included studies must provide
insights relevant to organizational transformation, and specifically to the
research questions. The third facet underlines the particular contribution we
aim to provide with this research, namely the exclusive focus on large
organizations. These three facets were used for inclusion and exclusion in each
study selection step, including search string design, filtering by abstracts,
and full text filtering.

Examples on topics excluded by the first facet are agile manufacturing, and
applying Scrum practices in management boards, as these do not relate to
software engineering. In addition, we required that the organizational
transformation was aimed to introduce agile methods, which excluded other
development methods than agile \cite{Sagesser2013}, and use of agile
methods in other contexts than software development \cite{Hodgkins2007}.

The facet of \emph{organizational transformation} was interpreted so that the
primary study must present insights on the process of transformation. This
was the most important facet, as the pivot of this research is to examine
how the transformations happen. Examples on excluded topics are comparing the
original and agile development methods \cite{Petersen2010}, discussing use of
agile in a large organization but not describing how the new methods were
introduced \cite{Mishra2011}, and merely presenting agile tools in large scale
use \cite{Kim2012}. These sources were excluded as they did not privide insights
on organizational transformation.
% Also [Fitzgerald 2005] on just presenting use of agile methods, no introducing

Transformation and ``scaling up'' are very closely related and in some cases
they are one and the same. For instance, if transformation begins with a pilot
and spreads gradually through the organization, the process can very well be
seen as a ``scaling up'' journey. However, we excluded cases where a initially
small organization was scaled up \cite{Maranzato2012}, and discussions with a
process centered viewpoint without describing organizational change
\cite{Lyon2008}.
% Also [Greening 2010] on process centered viewpoint without transformation

The facet of \emph{large scale} was interpreted as presented in section
\ref{sec:largescale}, having 50 development personel or 6 teams as as the limit
for large scale. In some cases the source presented very vague indicators on
size. For instance, we deemed the case presented by Cloke \cite{Cloke2007} to be
included as there was indications of large scale considerations, although the
size remained unclear. The case presented by Miller and Haddad \cite{Miller2012}
was deemed to be excluded as there was no indications whatsoever on size. A
borderline exclude was the case presented by Tudor \cite{Tudor2006} as there was
no indication of issues indicating large size, althoug there were several
development teams.
To complicate matters, some papers talked about ``the team'' in singular when
referring to the organization \cite{Hodgkins2007}, making it clearly nontrivial
to judge whether an organization was large based on the choice of words of the
author.

A further example on exclusion by the \emph{large scale} facet were cases with
large organizations but only a single team adopting agile \cite{Fulgham2011}.
We considered cases of single teams (although in large organizations) unrelated
to this research as our focus is on transformation of the entire organization.
Also piloting cases that resulted only in single teams using agile were excluded
\cite{Scott2008}.

% Also [Jensen 2003] with only a single team
% Possibly [Mc Cormic 2005] on single team piloting

In addition to the criteria listed above we excluded studies that were not
empirical. We excluded textbooks, studies merely presenting theories, and other
studies that did not include any case organization. We also excluded studies of
benefits or limitations of agile in general. Lastly, we excluded student
experiments as it is implausible to simulate the dynamics of a large
organization in an experiment.


\subsubsection{Preliminary searches}

% --> Why are the preliminary searches done?

Before proceeding with the database search a number of preliminary searches were
performed. The purpose of the preliminary searches was to create a benchmark of
potentially relevant papers that should be matched by the actual database
search. We also wanted to list top ranked hits by trivial keywords that the
more complex final search string might miss. Initial searches were made using
keywords that were as general as possible, including ``agile transformation''
and ``large scale agile''. Additionally, a trial keyword search was done in the
selected databases (listed in table \ref{table:databases}) using the following
search string:

\begin{verbatim}
((agil* OR scrum OR xp OR lean) AND
(transform* OR transit* OR change OR migrat*) AND
((large AND (scale OR organization))) OR enterprise)
\end{verbatim}

From these preliminary searches we compiled a list of 117 possibly relevant
papers that should be matched by the actual database search.

\subsubsection{Study selection}

The study selection process inlcuded three steps, each step refining the set of
selected papers. First a database search was used to gather an initial set of
papers. This set was then refined by filtering out abstracts and finally full
text filtering. The study selection process is outlined in Figure
\ref{fig:selectionprocess}.

\begin{figure}[b]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{graphics/research_process.pdf}
    \caption{Study selection process}
    \label{fig:selectionprocess}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

A keyword search in online databases was chosen as the means to find potential
primary studies. The databases included in the search are listed in Table
\ref{table:databases}. All databases supported use of complex boolean logic in
searches which allowed us flexibility when constructing the search strings.

\begin{table}
    \begin{tabular}{ p{0.28\textwidth} l l }
        \toprule
        Database         & URL                         & N of matches   \\
        \midrule
        IEEExplore       & http://ieeexplore.ieee.org      & 745 \\ 
        ACM              & http://dl.acm.org               & 168 \\
        Scopus           & http://www.scopus.com/home.url  & 1596 \\
        Web of Knowledge & http://apps.webofknowledge.com  & 786 \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Databases included in search, and number of matched articles}
    \label{table:databases}
\end{table}

We constructed a search string based on the facets \emph{agile software
deveolpment} and \emph{organizational transformation}, as presented in section
\ref{sec:inclusioncriteria}. Preliminary searches had showed that picking
keywords with good precision was difficult. Therefore we decided to exclude the
facet \emph{large scale} from the keyword search, with the consequence of
increasing the manual filtering effort in the subsequent steps.
Having a substantial part of the matches in non-relevant areas such as agile
manufacturing, we included only articles including the term ``software'' or
articles published in relevant conferences. Instead of engineering the search
terms any further, which proved to result in excluding some relevant articles,
we chose to rely more on manual filtering. The resulting facets and keywords are
listed in Table \ref{table:searchterms}.

\begin{table}
    \begin{tabular}{ p{0.22\textwidth} p{0.76\textwidth} }
        \toprule
        Facet                  & Keywords   \\
        \midrule
        Agile methods\newline (before \& after) &
            \texttt{agile, scrum, "extreme programming",
            waterfall, "plan-driven", RUP}\\
        Organizational transformation &
            \texttt{transform*, transiti*, migrat*, journey, adopt*, deploy, introduc*,
            "roll-out", rollout}\\
        Only software\newline related atricles &
            \texttt{(software OR (conference="agile, xp, icgse, icse"))
            AND NOT (title+abs="manufacturing" OR conference="agile manufacturing")}
        \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Facets and related search terms used}
    \label{table:searchterms}
\end{table}

The database keyword search matched 1874 unique papers. The abstracts of these
papers were categorized independently by both Dikert and Paasivaara into three
categories: include, excude, and uncertain. The result was combined by marking
abstracts both researchers agreed on for inclusion or exclusion respecitvely.
The inclusion of disagreed or uncertain abstracts was resolved through
discussion. At this stage papers were excluded only if both reserachers deemed
it clearly irrelevant, including any uncertain cases for full text filtering. As
a result 170 papers were selected for full text filtering.

We also evaluated the keyword search against the benchmark created in the
preliminary search step, concluding that 75 of the 117 preliminarily selected
papers matched. The missed 32 preliminary papers were examined, resulting in
including 3 additional papers as primary sources.

Full text filtering was performed by evaluating each article against the three
facets of the inclusion criteria. Filtering was done in two steps. In the first
step Dikert extracted data relevant to the three facets of the inclusion
criteria. Based on the extracted data 76 papers could be immediately deemed as
included or excluded. The remaining 94 papers were evaluated against the
inclusion criteria by both Dikert and Paasivaara, and a decision was made after
discussing each paper separately. In difficult cases Lassenius was consulted to
reach a decision. As a result of the full text filtering 47 papers were selected
to be included.

In the full text filtering step the references of all papers were also examined
for relevance, including 2 referenced papers as primary sources. Most case study
papers used references very scarcely, mostly referencing well known descriptions
of agile methods.

Finally, counting 47 papers from the full text filtering step, 3 papers from
preliminary searches, and 2 papers from references, 52 papers were selected
as primary studies.

In several cases there were more than one primary study presenting the
transformation of the same organization. Even if the transformation of a single
organization was described in many studies all sources that passed the inclusion
criterial were included. Studies presenting the same organization were treated
as one unit so that we could gain as much insight from each organization as
possible. There were also a few papers that presented multiple case studies, and
in those cases we treated each studied organization individually. As a result 42
unique organizations were identified in the primary studies. We use the term
\emph{study} to refer to the primary study publications, and the term
\emph{case} to refer to an individual case organization that may be described in
several different studies.

\subsubsection{Study quality assessment}

The primary research for this literature review consists almost exclusively of
industry experience reports. This may be seen as a factor lessening the
evidence.
--> Why did we do this anyway?
--> Case studies with research method studying organizational transformations in
    software industry are very scarce.
--> Large organizational changes are hard to measure experimentally (controlled
    experiments?). Also due to this any student research was excluded.

The reason for deviating stydy assessment
--> Original research consisted almost solely of experience reports
--> The fact that experience reports have a subjective standpoint makes it
    unreliable to make quantitative conclusions based on the data
--> We also decided to include separate studies describing the same organization.
    This was useful as it deepened the understanding of each case, and several
    large organizations have produced more than one description of their agile
    transformation.

The fact that the study is based on a quantitative basis
--> Experie reports have a subjective bias
--> The data synthesis must not rely on quantitative measures. This means that
    we also considered topics raised by only a marginal number of reports.
--> It may still be interesting to make some quantitative observations such as
    a particular problem being reported in the majority of reports.

It was quite common that a single transformation case was described by many
papers. For example, one paper would highlight the viewpoint of developers
\cite{Fry2007}, and another would consider the transformation from user
experience designers' point of view \cite{Federoff2009}. Instead of using the
most complete paper as suggested by Kitchenham \cite{Kitchenham2007}, we
combined the results presented in each paper and considered the case as a single
unit. By doing this we avoided bias caused by duplicate publications, and were
enabled to have a more detailed view of the case organization.


\subsubsection{Coding of primary documents}

The primary documents were coded using the Atlas TI qualitative data analysis software.
An integrated deductive and inductive approach was chosen for coding the primary
studies \cite{Cruzes2011a}. The coding was designed to have a contextual part
and a findings part as also suggested by Cruzes and Dybå \cite{Cruzes2011a}. A
list of codes was established for contextual information, as presented in Table
\ref{table:contextualcodes}. Codes related to the research questions were chosen
to be created by an inductive process. The reason for inducting codes rather
than using an a priori approach was to avoid the researchers' previous
assumptions of the research area to affect the choice of codes

\begin{table}[h]
    \begin{tabular}{ p{0.28\textwidth} p{0.7\textwidth} }
        \toprule
        Contextual code     & Explanation   \\
        \midrule

Agile method & Agile methods used in the organization (eg. Scrum, XP) \\

Business area & The business area in which the organization operates. \\

Organization size & Mentioning the size of the case organization. \\

Time of\newline transformation & When the transformation has been in
progress, or how long the transformation has taken. Possibly relative to
the time of the research. \\

Research process & The paper describes a research process. \\

Geographical\newline location & Where the organization is located. \\

Large scale definition & A definition of "large scale" software development. \\

Multisite / GSD & Mentioning of a multisite organization. \\

        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Context information}
    \label{table:contextualcodes}
\end{table}

To give direction for code induction seven different code families were
established, as presented in Table \ref{table:codefamilies}. A description
defining scope and examples for codes were defined for each family. The example
codes would not necessarily be used as actual codes, and would not represent the
entire or final scope of the families.

\begin{table}[h]
    \begin{tabular}{ p{0.32\textwidth} p{0.65\textwidth} }
        \toprule
        Code family          &  Description
        \\
        \midrule

        RQ1: Reason to change &
        Reasons to start the transformation (demand for faster delivery). \\

		RQ2: Transformation\newline process &
		Statements that describe the transformation process (top-down, big bang,
		stepwise). \\

		RQ3: Challenges &
		Statements that present challenges in the transformation (change resistance).
		\\

		RQ3: Success factors &
		Statements that present success factors in the transformation (management
		support).
		\\

		Investing in change  &
		Factors that present how the organization is investing in the
		transformation (training, consultants, tools). \\

		Practices &
		Distinguishable practices that are used or established during transformation.
		Factors that are presented as neutral in terms of successes and challenges
		in the primary studies.
		(coaching, piloting, continuous integration, communities of practice) \\
		
		Contextual &
		Contextual codes defined in Table \ref{table:contextualcodes}. \\
		
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Code families}
    \label{table:codefamilies}
\end{table}

The inductive coding was done according to the guidelines described below.

A passage of text that presents any concept relating to the research questions
or the contextual codes becomes a quotation. If the quotation corresponds
closely to a concept that has already been coded the existing code is used.
Otherwise a new code is created, and the code is assigned to one of the
predefined code families. The labels of existing codes may need to be adjusted
when new quotations are assigned. Many codes may be assigned to one quotation
and quotations of different codes may be overlapping.

The length of the text passage that make up a quotation may vary. For the
contextual codes the quoted passage should be of minimal length. For other
quotes the length of the quotation should be long enough to highlight the
context of the concept the quotation, varying from a few sentences to one
paragraph, or even several paragraphs. As an example of context of the
quotation, if a transformation challenge is described by a quotation it would be
good if also the source or resolution of the challenge could be included in the
quoted text passage. Having enough context should broaden the understanding
of the coded concept when looking at the quotation in isolation..

% -- Considering that mentioning the inclusion of a factor as a success, then
%    would the absence of the same factor be a challenge?

The total accumulated codes and quotations of the integrated deductive and
inductive coding process are presented in Table \ref{table:codecount}. The total
number of quotations is less than the sum of quotations in the categories
because a single quotation may have multiple codes.

\begin{table}[h]
    \begin{tabular}{ l r r }
        \toprule
        Code family    &  Codes  &  Quotations

		RQ2: Transformation process &  16 &  580 \\
		RQ3: Challenges &              40 &  323 \\
		RQ3: Success factors &         44 &  260 \\

        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Number of codes and quotations per code family}
    \label{table:codecount}
\end{table}


\subsubsection{Validation of coding}

Coding was done by only one researcher due to resource constraints and volume of
source material. As recommended by Kitchenham \cite{Kitchenham2007} we conducted
an experiment with the goal to assess the consistency of coding that two
independent researchers may achieve.
In the experiment Dikert and Paasivaara coded independently a sample of five
primary documents. The sample was hand picked as a representative subset of the
source material. The coding was done relying solely on the guidelines presented
in the previous chapter, and the researchers were careful not to discuss the
choice of codes or interpretations relating to codes before the experiment was
completed. Finally the independent codings of the two researchers were analyzed
with two metrics: by the number of matching themes found, and by the amount of
overlap in quotations similar codes have.
% See Kitcenham, chapter 6.4

The metric of matching themes measures how well the independent researchers are
able to induct similar codes from the source material. As codes are inducted it
is likely that two researchers label similar quotes differently. To overcome
this problem we defined higher level themes under which the individual codes
were organized. Through discussion we made decisions on whether differently
labeled codes could be organized under the same theme or not. Table
\ref{table:codingexperiment} presents the total number of themes the researchers
found in each document, and how many of the themes were matching. We concluded
that on average two of three themes found by one researcher are similarly found
by the other researcher, but one of three themes is not found by the other
researcher.

The metric of quotation overlap measures how well the quotations for similar
codes match between two independent researchers. The intent is to measure how
codes that are deemed similar by their names match in the actual quoted text. On
a scale of 0 to 3 we evaluated the quoted text of codes in each theme that
matched for both researchers, as described in the previous paragraph. A score of
3 was given for matching codes whose quotation content was virtually the same
for both researchers. A score of 2 was given if the quotations were mostly the
same, but other researcher had included one text passage that the other had
missed. A score of 1 was given if roughly half of the quotations were the same.
If the quotations had less similarity than this a score of 0 was given. One code
provided typically 1 to 3 quotations per document. The quotation overlap score
was counted including only codes that had matching themes. We concluded that the
average quotation overlap score was 2.2.

\begin{table}
    \begin{tabular}{ l r r r }
        \toprule
        Document    &  Matching themes  &  Total themes  &  Quotation overlap (0-3) \\
        \midrule
        P1          &  14  &  19   &  2.1  \\
        P2          &   6  &  11   &  2.4  \\
        P3          &   7  &  11   &  2.1  \\
        P4          &   2  &   4   &  2.3  \\
        P5          &  12  &  16   &  2.0  \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Result of independent coding experiment}
    \label{table:codingexperiment}
\end{table}

Combining the quotation overlap result and the result that inductive coding
yielded similar themes with a factor of two thirds, we conclude that two
different researchers should agree completely on at least half of the quotations
in the source material of our study. This agreement includes both that the
researchers select the same text passage as a quotation, and that researchers
agree with the meaning of the quotation. Further interpretation of the
quotations and codes will still remain a subjective matter.


\subsection{Limitations of research method}

-- A keyword search can not identify the facet of \emph{large scale}, and also
   \emph{transformation} is difficult to capture with keywords. Because of this
   we assume that it is likely that a some studies have been missed by the
   keyword search. As an improvement we would suggest combining the entire
   archive of \emph{Agile Conference} and \emph{Agile Processes in Software
   Engineering and Extreme Programming} to the results of the keyword search.
   These two conferences provided more than two thirds of the pimary sources.

-- Few of the primary studies presented a research method. Most of the studies
   were experience reports where the author was a member of the organization
   discussed. Because of this we must assume that the primary studies are
   biased. Due to this risk of bias we chose not to make statistical
   interpretations of the results. We only use relative measure when comparing
   results.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

This section presents the findings of the literature review. In the first
subsection a meta analysis of the analyzed papers is presented. In the
subsequent sections findings are presented organized according to the research
questions. The methods used for extracting the results were described in section
\ref{sec:method}. Note that the term \emph{study} is used when refering to a
primary study publication, and the term \emph{case} is used when refering to an
organization which may be described in several studies.

\subsection{Overview of primary studies}

The results of this study include findings from 52 primary studies presenting
how 42 different large software organizations introduce agile methods. Most of
the included studies were experience reports (45 studies), and in many cases it
was evident that the author had been personally involved in the transformation.
Only 6 of the included studies had a research method explicitly stated. One of
the studies was an interview article. The publication forums of the primary
studies were distributed so that 57 sources were conference proceedings, 4
sources were journal articles, and one source was a technical report.

    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{graphics/organization_size.pdf}
    \caption{Distribution of organization sizes in primary studies}
    \label{fig:organization_size}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The size of the organizations varied from the minimum included size of 50 to
18,000 people. The median size was 300 people. In 7 studies the size was
presented in terms of teams, ranging from the minimum of 6 teams to 150 teams.
The median was 10 teams. In 8 studies there was no direct indication on size
but the issues discussed revealed that the organization was of large size
accoding to our definition. The distribution of organization sizes is presented
in figure \ref{fig:organization_size}.

Figure \ref{fig:transformation_time} summarizes the publication years of the
primary studies, and the years when the transformations were reported to have
started. All studies and transformations were dated after year 2000. There were
peaks in transformation studies in years 2008 and 2011. The studies were
typically published two years after the start of the transformation.

\end{table}

The business areas of the case organizations are presented in table
\ref{table:businessareas}. Different business areas were represented somewhat
evenly. Online services was the largest group, including companies
providing software as a service solutions for businesses, online media players
for consumers, online services for consumers, and communication software for
businesses. The second largest group was telecommunications, including companies
such as British Telecom, Cisco, Ericsson, and Nokia Siemens Networks. The third
largest group was enterprise management solution providers with products for
business process management, project protfolio management, and facility
management.


\subsection{Agile methods used}

The agile methods reported being used in the transformed organizations are
summarized in table \ref{table:agilemethods}. The most prevalent method was
Scrum, which was the sole agile method mentioned in 25 cases. The second most
mentioned agile method was Extreme Programming (XP). Lean software development
was mentioned in some studies, although combined to Scrum in all cases. Other
agile methods mentioned were Unified Process, ADM, and Rapid Application
Development. In one case the agile method was not named.

It was quite common that organizations sought to combine agile methods.
Especially Scrum, XP, and Lean software development were used together. In
addition, many cases mentinoed use of XP practices without explicitly stating XP
as the process being used (such as test driven development and continuous
integration). Combining and customizing agile practices was also evident in that
many organizations viewed the agile method as continuously evolving.
Organizations evolved the agile methods for instance through retrospectives and
continuous improvement.

\subsection{Reasons to change}

As stated by Research Question 1 we investigated the reasons organizations start
a transformation process towards agile software development. In most primary
reasons for starting the transformation were mentioned, and only 7 cases of 42
did not mention any reasons. In the cases giving no specific reason to change it
was simply mentioned that management had decided to change the organization.
The reasons for organizations to change that were found are presented in table
\ref{table:reasonstochange}.

    \caption{Summarizing why large organizations initiate an agile transformation (RQ1).
             The table presents a hierarchial view of reasons for the organization to change.}
    \label{table:reasonstochange}
\end{table}

The reasons to change were are grouped in three top-level categories: external
issues, internal issues, and communication issues. External issues are related
to the business area which the organization is operating in. Internal issues are
related to the way the organization is managed and software is being developed.
Communication issues represent problems in communication and coordination in
software projects.

The most prominent reason for introducing agile methods was the demand to
deliver software more frequently. A frequent statement was that it was necessary
to reduce the Time To Market (TTM) [P17, P18, P32, P39, P47]. As stated in one
study ``The market was moving faster than the development group was able to
deliver'' [P38].







* TTM, lead time

[P17]
Faster TTM
"BMC decided to introduce a new generation of their own successful products before competitors could."

[P17]
Product needs to be improved quickly.
The deadline is looming (TTM) "Target delivery of the first release was less than a year away"

[P18]
Reduce TTM "Ericsson set a corporate R\&D goal to reduce Time to Market"
Faster cycles became necessary "This forced the PDU to deliver products in much short cycles."

[P18]
Reduction in lead time, increase in responsiveness, "both appealing and necessary" "in our ‘new’ multimedia market place"

[P32]
TTM must be reduced
"BT is facing rapid marketplace changes that require it to radically increase its speed to market."

[P38]
TTM must be improved, to remain competitive
"The market was moving faster than the development group was able to deliver."

[P39]
The TTM needed to be shortened
The testing time needed to be shortened

[P47]
There was a desire to reduce TTM



* Long cycle time is seen as a problem in itself

[P2]
They THINK that agile will make them deliver faster

[P8]
There are challenges in achieving faster and more frequent delivery.

[P25]
Long cycle time is seen as a general problem

[P33]
Long cycles is seen as a problem in itself
"the number of releases had slowed to one major release per year"

[P36]
A "small system" needed to be put in place as fast as possible

[P41]
The goal was to "deliver better quality faster"

[P16]
Lack of feedback
"many people in R\&D had not participated in a major release"
Release cycles are too long, which is clearly problematic

[P49]
It takes ``too long to develop''
It takes ``too long to deploy''
Too little assurance that the result will be good in the changing marketplace
"software was taking too long to develop, too long to deploy, and providing too
little assurance that what was either developed or deployed was really going to
ferry the corporation through the tumultuous waters of its marketplace"

* Slowness combined with cost

[P36]
It is realized that development was slow, and needs to be improved
"Business ... felt the all-too-common frustrations with the pace and cost of development."

[P46]
Development is "too slow and too expensive across the board"



* Customers or ``business'' demand shorter cycles

[P23]
Speed of delivery
"Speed of delivery is of the essence – customers are no longer prepared to wait for 18 months or more for solutions to be delivered."

[P39]
Project stakeholders demand "as early releases as possible"

[P46]
Business cared only about speed to value.

[P5]
New solutions must be delivered on a fast schedule
"The engineering team had to deliver rapid incremental improvement."
Software quality needs to be improved.
"Business pressure for rapid improvement was growing."
"The organization would be required to demonstrate significant improvement in a very short timeframe. It was clear traditional software development methodologies simply would not work."



* Length delivery is a problem in the competition

[P11]
"we couldn't do business as usual" --> delivery speed must be increased, to remain competitive

[P19]
Fear of competitors, something must be done
Long release cycles/duration are "an alarming state that could enable competitors to gain market share"



* Faster is better ROI

[P8]
Provide within shorter cycles in order to focus on highest ROI



* Timeliness, accuracy

[P9]
Product deliveries must be timely, to remain competitive

[P15]
The number of releases needed to be increased, for accuracy




% Some cases reported that the organization had been successful in waterfall
% delivery for a long time before the agile transformation.



\subsection{Transformation process}

\subsubsection{The initial state of the organization}

We investigated the initial state of the case organizations before the
transformation. The typical initial process model was described as waterfall, as
stated in 25 cases. In several cases the authors characterized the initial state
of the organization as ``traditional''. CMMI was presented as a driver for the
original process in 4 cases. Other process models the studies named were RUP
[P19], Prince2 [P51], and Macroscope [P14]. In 9 cases the initial state was not
described.

The old model was described in most cases briefly and in a neutral sentiment.
Waterfall development in general was referred to as ``traditional, plan-based
methods'' [P25], ``traditional phase-based approach'' [P36], or ``old fashioned
process driven waterfall'' [P23]. Korhonen [P25] referred to the model presented
by Royce \cite{Royce1970} when describing the initial state.

In some cases specifics of the old model was criticized. The characteristics of
the old process models were described as having ``many gates and sign-offs
required by upper levels of management'' [P9], ``lot of bureaucracy in project
management and a strict hierarchy of requirements communication'' [P39], and
``project managers typically used a command-and-control philosophy'' [P44].

In a few cases the initial process model was less rigid, and closer to the agile
model that was to be introduced. Examples of such loose process models were
described: ``The choice of development methodology is one of any number of
degrees of freedom granted to teams at Amazon. Development teams are expected to
solve their problems in the best way possible'' [P3], ``the R\&D group leveraged
a loose, waterfall-based process with an entrepreneurial culture'' [P16]. Some
organizations had even signs of agile development on team level although the
surrounding organization operated in a waterfall fashion. This was described as
``Agile and Scrum were increasingly popular and emerging at a grass-roots level,
at a corporate level Yahoo! still embraced a more traditional product
development process'' [P10], and ``some teams had applied scrum on the team
level, despite the surrounding organization that was working with a waterfall
software engineering model'' [P26].

In a few cases the organization initailly lacked strict process. For instance
Long describes the initial state in the following way: ``Project scope was in
constant flux. Well-meaning market and product owners routinely inserted new
requirements during product development.'' [P30].

Some authors describe the developement being originally organized in silos. For
instance Ranganath describes that ``Teams operated in silos. Collaboration,
shared purpose and ownership for outcomes were hard to find'' [P40].
