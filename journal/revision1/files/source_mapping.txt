We identified 52 primary studies, discussing how 42 different large scale software organizations introduced agile methods. Table \ref{table:experiencereports} and Table \ref{table:casestudies} list the cases and primary sources. Some key contextual information on the organizations is included in the tables. We reference the primary studies with a capital P and a number, and the unique case organizations with a capital C and a number. Whereas none of the case studies had their research focus directly on the transformation process, they provided similar information as shallow experience reports to our study.
