Reviewer #3:
The result set of the paper is somewhat weak because most of it consists of experience reports. However, this is not a problem as such. Rather, the problem arises because the authors have tried to draw conclusions that go beyond what the source material would allow in terms of generalisability. The authors could have used the result set differently, e.g. by separating the experience reports and case studies and analysed them separately, with the experience reports contributing to an understanding of relevant problems in practice, and the case studies contributing to the actual SLR.
&
Will be looked at

We have now included a table which distinguishes the case studies and experience reports. The first thing to consider is that only 6 cases out of 42 are case studies, which simply points out that the body of studies is limited on our subject. Secondly, the actual research focus tended to be more on the current practice than the transformation process. Also, studies with the main focus overlapping with our research presented significantly less relevant insights than the average experience report. Because of this the case studies provided surprisingly little relevant material in comparison to the experience reports.

It seems that the transformation process in itself is not a popular subject for studies. This may be a bit disappointing if the goal would be to apply strict hierarchy of evidence criteria. However, we believe that aggregating what practitioners say about the transformations is also highly valuable, although the implications of possible biases in the source material must be kept in mind. In simple terms, our study reveals with strong evidence which are the main concerns that are brought up when agile transformations are discussed in general.

Reviewer #3:
The analysis is somewhat weak: the reason for undertaking the Agile transformation in the different cases is not addressed, nor are the contextual constraints. Differences in reasons, goals, and constraints likely mean that each challenge and success factor should come with additional information that helps the reader determine whether they apply in their own case. This information is largely missing in the paper.
&
Difficult and a lot of work. Contextual factors, goals etc. not well reported. Do we have 52 different contexts here?
& 
Kim
\\

We have added a table which lists the context of each primary study. This table summarizes the context of each organization.

Our interpretation is that the challenges and success factors do not relate to contextual factors. The large organizations described in the source material seem to all have their own specific characteristics. Because of this there was no evident connection between the context and the particular challenges and success factors.

Reviewer #3:
In 3.1., you could contextualise the research questions by explaining why these two questions are the most important ones to address in your SLR and why they are the only ones addressed.
Why, for example, did you not ask what application domains or types of software formed the context in reports on large-scale Agile transformations?
Why did you not ask what solutions, if any, have been proposed, tried, or validated for the challenges (and if none, why)?
Also, you should explain the relationship between the two research questions. Is your intention that they capture the two sides of introducing Agile in the large (i.e. failure and success) or do you mean that challenges are something else than the reverse of success factors?
&
Come up with good answers
& 
Kim \\

Answer:
We have now explained the choice of research questions. We have also added a table summarizing the business areas of the case organizations. The types of software being developed was typically not presented clearly enough in the primary studies.

We did not ask for solutions to the problems. The reason for this is twofold. Firstly, it is important to understand the problem before trying to provide a fix. Secondly, because each organization has its individual traits the solutions to problems may vary, whereas the problems may be similar.

Addition to "3.1 Research questions":
/Users/kimi/Desktop/SLR Journal/Revision-Kimi.txt
While large scale agile transformations could provide many viewpoints to use as research questions, we chose these two questions because we believe they represent the viewpoints which are likely to provide actionable insights to practitioners as well as researchers. The research questions are not intended to present complements to each other, but rather two distinct viewpoints which can highlight different characteristics in the transformations.

Other notes:

—> Getting answers to these questions provide insights that can be applied in practice

* Regarding asking for solutions to problems, and other viewpoints:

Being familiar with the body of primary studies we made the guess that the actual problems are reported more often than proposed solutions. Although many studies discussed solutions to problems, we could still confirm that the problems in themselves got more attention. For this reason it was simply practical to begin with looking at the problems themselves.

We believe that understanding the actual underlying problems will eventually form part of the solution to them. It is a logical first step to first identify the problems, and only after that look at the solutions. However, in some cases a proposed solution may give a practical insight into the underlying problem.

It was also practical to limit the focus of the study. The results would otherwise be impractically lengthy to be published as a journal article, or the results would need to be presented too shallowly. While we only looked at the problems in this study, our results leave a clearly defined gap in knowledge for the part of the solutions. This gap sets a well defined opportunity for further research.

As a final remark, we actually did both code and analyze the source material for a few other viewpoints. The research questions set for this study represent the subject areas we think will provide the most substantial insights for both researchers and practitioners.

—> solutions vs problems. Problems are more often mentioned. I would be cautious about generalizing solutions, whereas it might make more sense to approach the problems in a generalizing way. Not all papers present solutions, but most of them present problems. Solutions become specific tools, which we have excluded.

* Regarding the relationship between the research questions:

We do not consider challenges and success factors as being complementary. Instead we consider them as two separate viewpoints, both of which can highlight different characteristics in the transformations. Obviously for some parts these two viewpoints do present complementary findings, but for other parts they highlight clearly different sets of characteristics in transformations. In this sense it is not our intention to set up a comparison between these two sides, and as stated above we do consider them as something else than the reverses of each other.

* Overall action points:
—> Add one sentence clarifying why we chose the two research questions
—> Add one sentence clarifying our intention that we do not look at success factors and challenges as complements
—> Add table listing the application domains, as additional contextual information

Reviewer #3:
In 3.2.7, you first state that part of your coding was inductive, but then you say that you began by a set of a priori codes. This is probably reasonable, but you could also have started developing the codes completely out of the primary studies. This could have eliminated more of your personal biases. I think the approach you chose is fine, but would have like to see more information on how you established the a priori codes. Were they perhaps based on some other material that you have read previously? If so, perhaps the codes can be considered as inductively derived from those sources? Or perhaps you consider them as being derived somehow from the research questions - but how? Please be a bit more precise here.
&
Based on four original research questions. Practices, investing in change. 
&
Kim \\

Answer:

The things defined a priori were the contextual codes, and a few evident code families. Everything else was inductive. This has now been clarified in section 3.2.7.


Edit in "3.2.7 Coding of primary studies":

We coded the primary studies using an integrated deductive and inductive approach, coding both a contextual and a findings part \cite{Cruzes2011a}. We established an a priori list of codes for contextual information, which included the codes agile method used, business area, organization size, time of transformation, research process used, geographical location, definition of large-scale used in the paper, and multisite case. Codes related to the research questions were created by an inductive process to avoid having our previous assumptions affect the choice of codes.

To guide inductive coding, we established five different code families a priori: reasons to change, transformation process, challenges, success factors, and contextual. In addition to these five evident families two additional families were established during the coding process: investing in change, and practices. A description defining the scope and containing examples of codes were defined for each family. The example codes would not necessarily be used as actual codes, and would not represent the entire or final scope of the families. Table~\ref{table:codefamilies} presents the codes families in the final state of the coding. Table~\ref{table:codefamilies} also shows the total number of codes and quotations created in the coding process. The total number of quotations is less than the sum of quotations in the categories because a single quotation may have multiple codes.

Reviewer #3:
Related to 4.2 and Table 5, it would be useful to see the degree of support for the different challenges and categories: how many sources mentioned each challenge and thus supported each category? Table 5 provides this information but the reader has to count the number of sources. A more accessible representation with both absolute and relative numbers would be welcome in addition to Table 5, as this would give an indication of the prevalence of the challenges and categories.
&
Add numbers and disclaimers to the text. Mentions in number of cases. Table with mapping between papers and cases needed.
& 
Kim
\\


Answer:
We have now added cross references to case organizations to the challenges and success factor tables. We also added a column presenting the number of cases each factor was presented in and a percentage of the number per the total of 42 cases.

With the number of cases mentioning a factor, and especially the percentage, we do not intend to suggest evidence on the actual frequency of the factors. These numbers merely present the frequency of mentioning in the source material. The number could be considered as how popular topics the factors are in discussion relating to transformations.


Addition:
Update the challenge and success tables.


Addition to "3.2.8 Synthesis of primary studies based on coding":
The tables presenting the categories of challenges and success factors reference the primary studies and case organizations. We have added a count of how many individual cases mentioned each factor, and a percentage of this count relative to the 42 individual cases. The purpose of these counts is to give the reader a sense of how often the factor was mentioned. We want to note that merely the frequency of mentioning does not make as generalizable evidence for the actual importance of the factors.


—> List the 42 individual cases
—> Map per challenge/success factor to each case
—> In challenges and successes tables, list case references per item; percent of cases mentioning

—> Lisää teksti, miksi ongelma % ei välttämättä ole hyödyllistä tietoa. Otos ei ole "edustava otos", eli yleistettävyydestä ei kerro.

Reviewer #3:
In 4.2.1, you have classified skepticism as a challenge or problem. Why? You have noted that most of your sources are experience reports, many written by people who were involved in the transformation. It must be assumed that there is a possibility that those authors have a vested interest in carrying out the transformation. It is then natural that their report would be biased against those who are skeptical towards the transformation. Skepticism does not seem to be the challenge; lack of information, lack of solid reasoning and evidence, and lack of a balanced view seem to be the real challenges.
&
&
Kim \\

—> Skepticism was (kind of) mentioned by that exact word.
—> muuta sana "skepticism". Ehkä reservedness?
—> Tää pitää katsoa TI:stä


Answer:
We added a sentence explaining the relevance of finding mentioning of skepticism in the primary sources. Our goal is to only aggregate what is presented in the primary studies. As such, we can not make assumptions on what the consequences, if any, were related to the reservedness in the organization. Based on what the source material brings out for this part, the only valuable observation we can make is that a skeptical attitude is being mentioned. Lastly, whereas skepticism is not a challenge in itself, we think it is worth mentioning, and since we need to somehow categorize the findings the challenges department is a sensible fit.


Addition "4.2.1 Change resistance / Skepticism towards new model.":

With skepticism we refer to any kind of reservedness towards the new model. While it can not be considered as a problem on its own, it is still worth to acknowledge that reservedness is mentioned in many cases.



##################################################################
Reviewer #3:
Section 4.2.5 (and the corresponding category) is named "challenges specific to large-scale". However, it is unclear how the challenges in this category are specific to large scale compared to those in the other categories. How did you identify that these are specific to large scale? Are the other categories not relevant for large scale? If not, why? If they are, what is their relationship to large scale? I also could not see how the challenges in this category would be specific to large scale. For example, using old and new models side by side, management in waterfall mode, and interpretation of agile differs between teams are probably just as bad in a smaller organisation.
&
Kimi: others might be applicable also in smaller organizational settings; these are clearly the result of the scaling
