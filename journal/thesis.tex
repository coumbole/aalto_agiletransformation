% The input files (tex files) are encoded with the latin-1 encoding 
% (ISO-8859-1 works). Change the latin1-option if you use UTF8 
% (at some point LaTeX did not work with UTF8, but I'm not sure
% what the current situation is) 
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

% OT1 font encoding seems to work better than T1. Check the rendered
% PDF file to see if the fonts are encoded properly as vectors (instead
% of rendered bitmaps). You can do this by zooming very close to any letter 
% - if the letter is shown pixelated, you should change this setting 
% (try commenting out the entire line, for example).  
\usepackage[OT1]{fontenc}

% The babel package provides hyphenating instructions for LaTeX. Give
% the languages you wish to use in your thesis as options to the babel
% package (as shown below). You can remove any language you are not
% going to use.
% Examples of valid language codes: english (or USenglish), british,

% Optional packages
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Select those packages that you need for your thesis. You may delete
% or comment the rest.

% Natbib allows you to select the format of the bibliography references.
% The first example uses numbered citations: 
%\usepackage[square,sort&compress,numbers]{natbib}
% The second example uses author-year citations.
\usepackage[square]{natbib}

% If you use author-year citations, change the bibliography style (below); 
% acm style does not work with author-year citations.
% Also, you should use \citet (cite in text) when you wish to refer
% to the author directly (\citet{blaablaa} said blaa blaa), and 
% \citep when you wish to refer similarly than with numbered citations
% (It has been said that blaa blaa~\citep{blaablaa}).

% The alltt package provides an all-teletype environment that acts
% like verbatim but you can use LaTeX commands in it. Uncomment if 
% you want to use this environment. 
% \usepackage{alltt}

% The eurosym package provides a euro symbol. Use with \euro{}
\usepackage{eurosym} 

% Verbatim provides a standard teletype environment that renderes
% the text exactly as written in the tex file. Useful for code
% snippets (although you can also use the listings package to get
% automatic code formatting). 
\usepackage{verbatim}

% The listing package provides automatic code formatting utilities
% so that you can copy-paste code examples and have them rendered
% nicely. See the package documentation for details.
% \usepackage{listings}

% The fancuvrb package provides fancier verbatim environments 
% (you can, for example, put borders around the verbatim text area
% and so on). See package for details.
% \usepackage{fancyvrb}

% Supertabular provides a tabular environment that can span multiple 
% pages. 
%\usepackage{supertabular}
% Longtable provides a tabular environment that can span multiple 
% pages. This is used in the example acronyms file. 
\usepackage{longtable}

% The fancyhdr package allows you to set your the page headers 
% manually, and allows you to add separator lines and so on. 
% Check the package documentation. 
% \usepackage{fancyhdr}

% The titlesec package can be used to alter the look of the titles 
% of sections, chapters, and so on. This example uses the ``medium'' 
% package option which sets the titles to a medium size, making them
% a bit smaller than what is the default. You can fine-tune the 
% title fonts and sizes by using the package options. See the package
% documentation.
\usepackage[medium]{titlesec}


% The aalto-thesis package provides typesetting instructions for the
% standard master's thesis parts (abstracts, front page, and so on)
% Load this package second-to-last, just before the hyperref package.
% Options that you can use: 
%   mydraft - renders the thesis in draft mode. 
%             Do not use for the final version. 
%   doublenumbering - [optional] number the first pages of the thesis
%                     with roman numerals (i, ii, iii, ...); and start
%                     arabic numbering (1, 2, 3, ...) only on the 
%                     first page of the first chapter
%   twoinstructors  - changes the title of instructors to plural form
%   twosupervisors  - changes the title of supervisors to plural form

% Hyperref
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Hyperref creates links from URLs, for references, and creates a
% TOC in the PDF file.
% This package must be the last one you include, because it has
% compatibility issues with many other packages and it fixes
% those issues when it is loaded.
\RequirePackage[pdftex]{hyperref}
% Setup hyperref so that links are clickable but do not look
% different
\hypersetup{colorlinks=false,raiselinks=false,breaklinks=true}
\hypersetup{pdfborder={0 0 0}}
\hypersetup{bookmarksnumbered=true}
% The following line suggests the PDF reader that it should show the
% first level of bookmarks opened in the hierarchical bookmark view.
\hypersetup{bookmarksopen=true,bookmarksopenlevel=1}
% Hyperref can also set up the PDF metadata fields. These are
% set a bit later on, after the thesis setup.


% Thesis setup
% ==================================================================
% Change these to fit your own thesis.
% \COMMAND always refers to the English version;
% \FCOMMAND refers to the Finnish version; and
% \SCOMMAND refers to the Swedish version.
% You may comment/remove those language variants that you do not use
% (but then you must not include the abstracts for that language)
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% If you do not find the command for a text that is shown in the cover page or
% in the abstract texts, check the aalto-thesis.sty file and locate the text
% from there. 
% All the texts are configured in language-specific blocks (lots of commands
% that look like this: \renewcommand{\ATCITY}{Espoo}.
% You can just fix the texts there. Just remember to check all the language
% variants you use (they are all there in the same place).

% Layout settings
% ------------------------------------------------------------------

% When you write in English, you should use the standard LaTeX 
% paragraph formatting: paragraphs are indented, and there is no 
% space between paragraphs.
% When writing in Finnish, we often use no indentation in the
% beginning of the paragraph, and there is some space between the 
% paragraphs. 

% If you write your thesis Finnish, uncomment these lines; if 
% you write in English, leave these lines commented! 
% \setlength{\parindent}{0pt}
% \setlength{\parskip}{1ex}

% Use this to control how much space there is between each line of text.
% 1 is normal (no extra space), 1.3 is about one-half more space, and
% 1.6 is about double line spacing.  
% \linespread{1} % This is the default
% \linespread{1.3}

% Bibliography style
% acm style gives you a basic reference style. It works only with numbered
% references.
%\bibliographystyle{acm}
% Plainnat is a plain style that works with both numbered and name citations.
\bibliographystyle{plainnat}


% Extra hyphenation settings
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% You can list here all the files that are not hyphenated correctly.
% You can provide many \hyphenation commands and/or separate each word
% with a space inside a single command. Put hyphens in the places where
% a word can be hyphenated.
% Note that (by default) LaTeX will not hyphenate words that already
% have a hyphen in them (for example, if you write ``structure-modification 
% operation'', the word structure-modification will never be hyphenated).
% You need a special package to hyphenate those words.
\hyphenation{di-gi-taa-li-sta yksi-suun-tai-sta}



% The preamble ends here, and the document begins. 
% Place all formatting commands and such before this line.
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{document}
% This command adds a PDF bookmark to the cover page. You may leave
% it out if you don't like it...
\pdfbookmark[0]{Cover page}{bookmark.0.cover}
% This command is defined in aalto-thesis.sty. It controls the page 
% numbering based on whether the doublenumbering option is specified
\startcoverpage

% Cover page
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Options: finnish, english, and swedish
% These control in which language the cover-page information is shown
\coverpage{english}


% Abstracts
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Include an abstract in the language that the thesis is written in,
% and if your native language is Finnish or Swedish, one in that language.

% Abstract in English
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
\thesisabstract{english}{
Agile methods have become an appealing alternative for companies striving to
improve their performance, but the methods are originally designed for small and
individual teams. This creates unique challenges when introducing agile to large
organizations that do not consist of small autonomous development teams. Yet
large organizations do adopt agile methods, and there is a demand to better
understand the factors affecting the transformation process.

We conducted a systematic literature review including 52 publications on 42
industry cases, describing the process of taking agile methods into use in large
organizations.
The literature review process included the steps of gathering potential primary
studies using a database search, filtering the search results based on
defined inclusion criteria, and analysing the full text of included studies.
The filtering step was done independently by two researchers. The full text
analysis was done using open coding, and was performed by a single researcher.

The results of the literature review show that the primary motive for agile
adoption is that business demands more speed and flexibility.
Transformation usually involved pilot projects, training, and bringing in
external help.
Challenges were commonly caused by change resistance and lack of commitment and
investment in transformation. Particular challenges created by large scale were
implementing effective coordination between teams, and friction caused by
different level of adoption across the organization.
The most important success factors were management support, use of training and
coaching, and carefully customizing the agile model to fit the organization.
