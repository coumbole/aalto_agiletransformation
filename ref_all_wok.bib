Title = {Assimilation of agile practices in use},
Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS JOURNAL},

Volume = {22},
Number = {6},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Agile method use in information systems development (ISD) has grown
   dramatically in recent years. The emergence of these alternative
   approaches was very much industry-led at the outset, and while agile
   method research is growing, the vast majority of these studies are
   descriptive and often lack a strong theoretical and conceptual base.
   Insights from innovation adoption research can provide a new perspective
   on analysing agile method use. This paper is based on an exploratory
   study of the application of the innovation assimilation stages to
   understand the use of agile practices, focusing in particular on the
   later stages of assimilation, namely acceptance, routinisation and
   infusion. Four case studies were conducted, and based on the case study
   findings, the concepts of acceptance, routinisation and infusion were
   adapted and applied to agile software development. These adapted
   concepts were used to glean interesting insights into agile practice
   use. For example, it was shown that the period of use of agile practices
   does not have a proportional effect on their assimilation depths. We
   also reflected on the sequential assumption underlying the assimilation
   stages, showing that adopting teams do not always move through the
   assimilation stages in a linear manner.},

Title = {Making the leap to a software platform strategy: Issues and challenges},
Journal = {INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {54},
Number = {9},
Pages = {968-984},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Context: While there are many success stories of achieving high reuse
   and improved quality using software platforms, there is a need to
   investigate the issues and challenges organizations face when
   transitioning to a software platform strategy.
   Objective: This case study provides a comprehensive taxonomy of the
   challenges faced when a medium-scale organization decided to adopt
   software platforms. The study also reveals how new trends in software
   engineering (i.e. agile methods, distributed development, and flat
   management structures) interplayed with the chosen platform strategy.
   Method: We used an ethnographic approach to collect data by spending
   time at a medium-scale company in Scandinavia. We conducted 16 in-depth
   interviews with representatives of eight different teams, three of which
   were working on three separate platforms. The collected data was
   analyzed using Grounded Theory.
   Results: The findings identify four classes of challenges, namely:
   business challenges, organizational challenges, technical challenges,
   and people challenges. The article explains how these findings can be
   used to help researchers and practitioners identify practical solutions
   and required tool support.
   Conclusion: The organization's decision to adopt a software platform
   strategy introduced a number of challenges. These challenges need to be
   understood and addressed in order to reap the benefits of reuse.
   Researchers need to further investigate issues such as supportive
   organizational structures for platform development, the role of agile
   methods in software platforms, tool support for testing and continuous
   integration in the platform context, and reuse recommendation systems.

Abstract = {Context: Agile software development changes the nature of collaboration,
   coordination, and communication in software projects.
   Objective: Our objective was to understand the challenges of shared
   decision-making in agile software development teams.
   Method: We designed a multiple case study consisting of four projects in
   two software product companies that recently adopted Scrum. We collected
   data in semi-structured interviews, through participant observations,
   and from process artifacts.
   Results: We identified three main challenges to shared decision-making
   in agile software development: alignment of strategic product plans with
   iteration plans, allocation of development resources, and performing
   development and maintenance tasks in teams.
   Conclusion: Agile software development requires alignment of decisions
   on the strategic, tactical, and operational levels in order to overcome
   these challenges. Agile development also requires a transition from
   specialized skills to redundancy of functions and from rational to
   naturalistic decision-making. This takes time; the case companies needed
   from one to two years to change from traditional, hierarchical
   decision-making to shared decision-making in software development
   projects. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {We present an analysis of the evolution of a Web application project
   developed with object-oriented technology and an agile process. During
   the development we systematically performed measurements on the source
   code, using software metrics that have been proved to be correlated with
   software quality, such as the Chidamber and Kemerer suite and Lines of
   Code metrics. We also computed metrics derived from the class dependency
   graph, including metrics derived from Social Network Analysis. The
   application development evolved through phases, characterized by a
   different level of adoption of some key agile practices - namely pair
   programming, test-based development and refactoring. The evolution of
   the metrics of the system, and their behavior related to the agile
   practices adoption level, is presented and discussed. We show that, in
   the reported case study, a few metrics are enough to characterize with
   high significance the various phases of the project. Consequently,
   software quality, as measured using these metrics, seems directly
   related to agile practices adoption.},

Abstract = {While past research has contributed to the understanding of how

   their post-adoptive usage in organizations. By integrating theories from

   of agile practices in two major organizations. The results indicate
   relative advantage, team attitude and technical competence. championing,
   and top management support (TMS) are the key factors determining the
   extent to which agile practices can be assimilated into an organization.
   Specifically, both findings and this model confirm that the deeper the

Abstract = {In recent years there has been a noticeable shift in attention from
   those who use agile software development toward lean software
   development, often labelled as a shift ``from agile to lean{''}.
   However, the reality may not be as simple or linear as this label

   approaches and how they are applied in agile software development, we
   have examined 30 experience reports published in past agile software
   Conferences in which experiences of applying lean approaches in agile
   software development were reported. The analysis identified six types of
   lean application. The results of our study show that lean can be applied
   in agile processes in different manners for different purposes. Lean
   concepts, principles and practices are most often used for continuous
   agile process improvement, with the most recent introduction being the
   kanban approach, introducing a continuous, flow-based substitute to

Abstract = {Background: Antimicrobial resistance has reached globally alarming
   levels and is becoming a major public health threat. Lack of efficacious
   antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems was identified as one of
   the causes of increasing resistance, due to the lag time between new
   resistances and alerts to care providers. Several initiatives to track
   drug resistance evolution have been developed. However, no effective
   real-time and source-independent antimicrobial resistance monitoring
   system is available publicly.
   Objective: To design and implement an architecture that can provide
   real-time and source-independent antimicrobial resistance monitoring to
   support transnational resistance surveillance. In particular, we
   investigated the use of a Semantic Web-based model to foster integration
   and interoperability of interinstitutional and cross-border microbiology
   laboratory databases.
   Methods: Following the agile software development methodology, we
   derived the main requirements needed for effective antimicrobial
   resistance monitoring, from which we proposed a decentralized monitoring
   architecture based on the Semantic Web stack. The architecture uses an
   ontology-driven approach to promote the integration of a network of
   sentinel hospitals or laboratories. Local databases are wrapped into
   semantic data repositories that automatically expose local
   computing-formalized laboratory information in the Web. A central source
   mediator, based on local reasoning, coordinates the access to the
   semantic end points. On the user side, a user-friendly Web interface
   provides access and graphical visualization to the integrated views.
   Results: We designed and implemented the online Antimicrobial Resistance
   Trend Monitoring System (ARTEMIS) in a pilot network of seven European
   health care institutions sharing 70+ million triples of information
   about drug resistance and consumption. Evaluation of the computing
   performance of the mediator demonstrated that, on average, query
   response time was a few seconds (mean 4.3, SD 0.1x10(2) seconds).
   Clinical pertinence assessment showed that resistance trends
   automatically calculated by ARTEMIS had a strong positive correlation
   with the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network
   (EARS-Net) (rho = .86, P < .001) and the Sentinel Surveillance of
   Antibiotic Resistance in Switzerland (SEARCH) (rho = .84, P < .001)
   systems. Furthermore, mean resistance rates extracted by ARTEMIS were
   not significantly different from those of either EARS-Net (Delta = +/-
   0.130; 95\% confidence interval -0 to 0.030; P < .001) or SEARCH (Delta
   = +/- 0.042; 95\% confidence interval -0.004 to 0.028; P = .004).
   Conclusions: We introduce a distributed monitoring architecture that can
   be used to build transnational antimicrobial resistance surveillance
   networks. Results indicated that the Semantic Web-based approach
   provided an efficient and reliable solution for development of eHealth
   architectures that enable online antimicrobial resistance monitoring
   from heterogeneous data sources. In future, we expect that more health
   care institutions can join the ARTEMIS network so that it can provide a
   large European and wider biosurveillance network that can be used to
   detect emerging bacterial resistance in a multinational context and
   support public health actions.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the process of measuring the level of quality
   control process to ensure the quality of delivered software package
   during the development cycle. The success of the project requires three
   prerequisites and they constrain one another. Quality is the most
   important factor for successful project completion. In other words,
   quality should not be sacrificed for the sake of meeting cost budget or
   delivering within schedule. Also, cost caused by any quality issues such
   as defect resolution increases exponentially once the product is out of
   the door. Having said that, we also have to consider the schedule side
   of constraints for the successful project. In other words, we have no
   time to do a quality job and we have to compete with other competitors
   to ship the product to the market earlier than them. So, the quality
   measurement and management concept is introduced to meet the agile
   software development environment in conjunction with performance
   strategies to execute within organization. Obviously, there are many key
   performance indexes derivable from the actual data associated with
   quality control activities and it is desirable to create a quality
   process to integrally represent overall level of quality control
   activities performed while developing the software deliverables. With
   the quality process, it is possible to evaluate whether enough quality
   control activities are performed for the project officially and secure
   the quality of the software deliverables before it is delivered to the
   customers.},

Abstract = {This case study examines how the lean ideas behind the Toyota production
   system can be applied to software project management. It is a detailed
   investigation of the performance of a nine-person software development
   team employed by BBC World-wide based in London. The data collected in
   2009 involved direct observations of the development team, the kanban
   boards, the daily stand-up meetings, semistructured interviews with a
   wide variety of staff, and statistical analysis.
   The evidence shows that over the 12-month period, lead time to deliver
   software improved by 37\%, consistency of delivery rose by 47\%, and
   defects reported by customers fell 24\%.
   The significance of this work is showing that the use of lean methods
   including visual management, team-based problem solving, smaller batch
   sizes, and statistical process control can improve software development.
   It also summarizes key differences between agile and lean approaches to
   software development.
   The conclusion is that the performance of the software development team
   was improved by adopting a lean approach. The faster delivery with a
   focus on creating the highest value to the customer also reduced both
   technical and market risks. The drawbacks are that it may not fit well

Journal = {INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {54},
Number = {2},
Pages = {137-148},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Context: Agile software development with its emphasis on producing
   working code through frequent releases, extensive client interactions
   and iterative development has emerged as an alternative to traditional
   plan-based software development methods. While a number of case studies
   have provided insights into the use and consequences of agile, few
   empirical studies have examined the factors that drive the adoption and
   use of agile.
   Objective: We draw on intention-based theories and a dialectic
   perspective to identify factors driving the use of agile practices among
   adopters of this software development methodology.
   Method: Data for the study was gathered through an anonymous online
   survey of software development professionals. We requested participation
   from members of a selected list of online discussion groups, and
   received 98 responses.
   Results: Our analyses reveal that subjective norm and training play a
   significant role in influencing software developers' use of agile
   processes and methods, while perceived benefits and perceived
   limitations are not primary drivers of agile use among adopters.
   Interestingly, perceived benefit emerges as a significant predictor of
   agile use only if adopters face hindrances to their agile practices.
   Conclusion: We conclude that research in the adoption of software
   development innovations should examine the effects of both enabling and
   detracting factors and the interactions between them. Since training,
   subjective norm, and the interplay between perceived benefits and
   perceived hindrances appear to be key factors influencing the adoption
   of agile methods, researchers can focus on how to (a) perform training
   on agile methods more effectively, (b) facilitate the dialog between
   developers and managers about perceived benefits and hindrances, and (c)
   capitalize on subjective norm to publicize the benefits of agile methods
   within an organization. Further, when managing the transition to new
   software development methods, we recommend that practitioners adapt
   their strategies and tactics contingent on the extent of perceived
   hindrances to the change. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Agile software development is well-known for its focus on close customer
   collaboration and customer feedback. In emphasizing flexibility,
   efficiency and speed, agile practices have lead to a paradigm shift in
   how software is developed. However, while agile practices have succeeded
   in involving the customer in the development cycle, there is an urgent
   need to learn from customer usage of software also after delivering and
   deployment of the software product. The concept of continuous
   deployment, i.e. the ability to deliver software functionality
   frequently to customers and subsequently, the ability to continuously
   learn from real-time customer usage of software, has become attractive
   to companies realizing the potential in having even shorter feedback
   loops. However, the transition towards continuous deployment involves a
   number of barriers. This paper presents a multiple-case study in which
   we explore barriers associated with the transition towards continuous
   deployment. Based on interviews at four different software development
   companies we present key barriers in this transition as well as actions
   that need to be taken to address these.},

   the required skills or time to solve a sophisticated problem on his own.
   Software development needs the involvement of different roles and people
   having to use concepts and ideas for which they need to share a common
   understanding. In such a context, several software development
   methodologies have appeared in the last thirty years. Those
   methodologies use different development life cycles, one of the most
   famous being the iterative one notably used by the Unified Process (UP)
   and agile methods. To teach software project managers and computer
   science students the required skills to deal with such development
   processes few approaches exist. Indeed, nowadays one mostly learns from
   ex-cathedra courses and books or on an empirical basis when involved
   into `real life' projects. Both learning approaches have major flaws
   since `theory-only' fails to highlight the practical dimension and
   empirical learning exposes the organization to damageable mistakes.
   e-SPM is an online multi-users game simulating the tasks of a software
   project manager facing user requirements, development planning, human
   resources allocation, budget constraints, risk and quality management
   within a UP/UML project in the steel industry. The originality of the
   game resides in its design based on the documentation and experience of
   previously performed real-life projects. The game mainly focuses on hard
   (technical) skills for project managers but also introduces random
   events showing to the player which soft skills are required in practice;
   it has been validated using the competencies framework of a business
   school.},

Abstract = {Educational games are essential in the next generation of e-learning
   tools because games stress visual and experiential learning; they
   require active involvement by student players while providing almost
   instantaneous feedback. The long term goal of this research project is
   to define a model-driven game engineering approach, SimSYS, that
   supports the rapid development of serious educational games across
   diverse educational topics. Here, we present our approach for modeling
   serious educational games, using tailored UML use cases (visual UML
   diagram and detailed tabular specifications). The tailored approach
   integrates features of storyboarding techniques (well-established in the
   game community), with use case modeling (well-established in the
   software engineering community). The use case model can be transformed
   into a formal XML representation that can be loaded by the SimSYS Game
   Play Engine. Part of a game on agile software development process is
   used for illustration.},

Abstract = {Code reviews are an integral part of the development of a dependable
   system such as for airport operations. It is commonly accepted that code
   reviews are an effective quality assurance technique even if a rigorous
   application is also a high cost factor. For large software systems a
   formal method may be inapplicable throughout the whole codebase. In this
   study an airport operational database (AODB) is developed with the
   application of a more lightweight approach to code reviews. A
   continuous, distributed and change-based process is applied by the
   development team and evaluated in comparison to team walkthroughs
   (IEEE-1028) as a baseline method.
   The application showed to be highly useful, equally effective as the
   baseline, but more efficient especially for the preparation, execution
   and rework effort. The results show that continuous code reviews also
   support the understanding of the codebase and the concept of collective
   ownership. Such processes may not completely substitute a more formal
   and effortful technique. Especially for reviewing critical design
   aspects or complex items a traditional approach is still more
   appropriate. The main outcome is that such lightweight code reviews may
   be used together with more formal approaches to ensure a high coverage
   and that the degree of formalism should be adopted to the criticality of
   the item under review.},

Abstract = {The agile paradigm is now a mainstream approach to software development,
   with Scrum emerging as the dominant methodology in the field. The rapid
   diffusion of the approach is an indicator of its current value to
   organizations but further gains seem possible. One major step would be
   the use of the agile approach in all organizational activity. This
   opportunity has always been part of the Scrum philosophy but few have
   attempted to put it into practice so far. The purpose of this paper is
   to consider what is involved, proposing a hierarchical Scrum model to
   make it suitable for such wider use. The proposal draws on established
   ideas from both Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) and Deming's
   Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle. The new model also has the potential to
   enhance the basic agile development process for software.},

Abstract = {The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has recently begun
   an effort to further refine its Fractionated Spacecraft vision. This
   vision (called the. ``F6{''} program) seeks to explore distributed
   spacecraft architectures capable of performing complex functions similar
   to current monolithic spacecrafts. However, the ability of fractionated
   systems to work separately would provide significant benefits not
   achievable by monolithic systems. The question of interest to this study
   was ``Can these benefits be quantified and evaluated in a meaningful
   fashion in order to compare them to monolithic architectures?{''}
   Rather than narrowing the approach to one or two concepts, the strategy
   was to expand the decision space in order to generate and evaluate a
   variety of alternatives under different scenarios and design choices.
   The stimuli were specifically selected to capture many issues not
   included in such studies such as technology obsolescence, funding
   profile changes, equipment failure scenarios, and even changes to
   mission objectives during the mission. Each stimulus has a variety of
   decision options or responses which a manager can exercise including
   delay, cancellation, acceleration of a development, or even new
   developments. It is argued that the very nature of fractionation will
   result in systems far more agile to external (and internal) stimuli, but
   this has never been shown explicitly. This study explores the use of
   Real Options in conjunction with traditional Net Present Value
   techniques to quantify the desirability of alternative candidate designs
   in terms of their adaptability and survivability.
   Our approach to evaluating the business case for each use case was to
   explicitly model both the implementation and operation phases for the
   life cycle of a fractionated cluster. The models were integrated into
   Phoenix Integration's ModelCenter (R) framework and used to generate
   Implementation Value Metrics (IVMs) and Operational Value Metrics (OVMs)
   associated with the use cases under evaluation. A number of models were
   developed to support these evaluations using Excel, Matlab, and Arena
   (R) (a commercial discrete-event simulation software product). The
   Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach used in this study
   yielded transformations between high-level frameworks (OWL and SysML)
   and the models used to generate the data we needed for the evaluation.
   This rule-based transformation process will be critical for exploring
   the large decision trade spaces in a reasonable amount of time.
   This paper presents the results of the business case analyses; the
   underlying OVM's and IVM's, the approaches used to model the problem,
   explore the tradespace, refine the exploration, and generate results. We
   also discuss possible directions for future work. Specifically, it
   should be noted that while the approach described herein is being
   developed for, and funded by, DARPA, it has general applicability to a
   much wider variety of applications.},

Abstract = {In the last decades the complexity of software development projects had
   a significant increase. This complexity emerges from the higher degree
   of sophistication in the contexts they aim to serve and from the
   evolution of the functionalities implemented by the applications
   However, many software corporations have a reduced dimension (micro,
   small or medium) which imposes a considerable constraint to the number
   of individuals that might be involved in each project. This limitation
   has obvious consequences to the individual's efficiency and
   effectiveness. In this paper we describe a Rational Unified Process
   (RUP) tailoring to simplify the number of RUP roles. With this tailoring
   we obtain one set of RUP roles that, without neglecting any critical
   role of the software development process, may easily be adopted by a
   small or medium software development team. In this paper, we present and
   justify a complete set of mapping rules between RUP roles and one
   possible configuration for small software development teams.},

Abstract = {Embedded systems are widely used in diverse areas, such as avionics,
   consumer electronics, and medical equipments, causing a considerable
   impact on modern society. Since these systems sometimes deal directly
   with human lives, and require a considerable level of quality, their
   development should be subject to a rigorous process. In another
   perspective, agile methods (or agile processes) have been adopted by the
   software industry as a lightweight, iterative, and collaborative
   approach for developing software systems. Although agile methods do not
   seem to be suitable to embedded systems, they have been successfully
   used for building such systems. However, there exists no detailed and
   analytical overview of the use of such methods in the embedded systems
   domain. The main objective of this paper is to present a detailed view
   of how agile methods have been used in the development of embedded
   systems, and to describe their benefits, challenges, and limitations.
   For this, we have applied Systematic Review, a technique for
   systematically exploring, organizing, summarizing, and assessing
   potentially all works conducted in a specific research area. As the main
   result, we have observed that agile methods have brought advantages to
   embedded systems development; however, more studies should be conducted.
   Furthermore, this work is also intended to contribute to the
   identification of important new research lines.},

Abstract = {We present a high fidelity cognitive radio (CR) network emulation
   platform for wireless system tests, measurements, and validation. This
   versatile platform provides the configurable functionalities to control
   and repeat realistic physical channel effects in integrated space, air,
   and ground networks. We combine the advantages of scalable simulation
   environment with reliable hardware performance for high fidelity and
   repeatable evaluation of heterogeneous CR networks. This approach
   extends CR design only at device (software-defined-radio) or lower-level
   protocol (dynamic spectrum access) level to end-to-end cognitive
   networking, and facilitates low-cost deployment, development, and
   experimentation of new wireless network protocols and applications on
   frequency-agile programmable radios. Going beyond the channel emulator
   paradigm for point-to-point communications, we can support simultaneous
   transmissions by network-level emulation that allows realistic
   physical-layer interactions between diverse user classes,including
   secondary users, primary users, and adversarial jammers in CR networks.
   In particular, we can replay field tests in a lab environment with real
   radios perceiving and learning the dynamic environment thereby adapting
   for end-to-end goals over distributed spectrum coordination channels
   that replace the common control channel as a single point of failure. CR
   networks offer several dimensions of tunable actions including channel,
   power, rate, and route selection. The proposed network evaluation
   platform is fully programmable and can reliably evaluate the necessary
   cross-layer design solutions with configurable optimization space by
   leveraging the hardware experiments to represent the realistic effects
   of physical channel, topology, mobility, and jamming on spectrumagility,
   situational awareness, and network resiliency. We also provide the
   flexibility to scale up the test environment by introducing virtual
   radios and establishing seamless signal-level interactions with real
   radios. This holistic wireless evaluation approach supports a
   large-scale,hete rogeneous, and dynamic CR network architecture and
   allows developing cross-layer network protocols under highfidelity,
   repeatable, and scalable wireless test scenarios suitable for
   heterogeneous space, air, and ground networks.},

Abstract = {The Multi Mission Bus Demonstrator (MBD) is a successful demonstration
   of agile program management and system engineering in a high risk
   technology application where utilizing and implementing new,
   untraditional development strategies were necessary. MBD produced two
   fully functioning spacecraft for a military/DOD application in a record
   breaking time frame and at dramatically reduced costs. This paper
   discloses the adaptation and application of concepts developed in agile
   software engineering to hardware product and system development for
   critical military applications. This challenging spacecraft did not use
   existing key technology (heritage hardware) and created a large paradigm
   shift from traditional spacecraft development.
   The insertion of new technologies and methods in space hardware has long
   been a problem due to long build times, the desire to use heritage
   hardware, and lack of effective process. The role of momentum in the
   innovative process can be exploited to tackle ongoing technology
   disruptions and allowing risk interactions to be mitigated in a
   disciplined manner. Examples of how these concepts were used during the
   MBD program will be delineated. Maintaining project momentum was
   essential to assess the constant non recurring technological challenges
   which needed to be retired rapidly from the engineering risk liens.
   Development never slowed due to tactical assessment of the hardware with
   the adoption of the SCRUM technique. We adapted this concept as a
   representation of mitigation of technical risk while allowing for design
   freeze later in the program's development cycle. By using Agile Systems
   Engineering and Management techniques which enabled decisive action, the
   product development momentum effectively was used to produce two novel
   space vehicles in a fraction of time with dramatically reduced cost.},

Abstract = {Agile methods gain the upper hand over traditional software development
   methods when it comes to constant customer participation, customer
   satisfaction with early project delivery and acceptance of requirement
   changes at any stage of software development life cycle. So the practice
   of agile methods has been increasing in recent years. Some of the
   well-known agile methods that are in practice today are Adaptive
   Software Development, Feature Driven Development, Scrum, eXtreme
   Programming. A comparison among different agile methods helps managers
   who need to introduce agility into their organization by providing a
   thorough knowledge on different features and aspects of the agile
   methods. By comparing different agile methods, managers can easily
   choose the agile method that best suites his project requirements and
   organizational characteristics. Different comparison techniques to
   compare agile methods were introduced in recent years by researchers. We
   have compared the agile methods Adaptive Software Development and
   Feature Driven Development in order to evaluate their degree of agility
   and coverage degree with respect to the two Knowledge Areas of SWEBOK,
   (1) Software Requirements, (2) Software Construction. The result of our
   comparison shows that Adaptive Software Development mainly differs from
   Feature Driven Development because there are no predefined techniques or
   specific practices that are meant to be followed in Adaptive Software
   Development. Feature Driven Development has some predefined techniques
   or practices that are to be followed during software development. The
   principle of Adaptive Software Development is to focus more on results
   rather than steps to achieve that result. A technique is only
   implemented if it is necessary to get the best output in Adaptive
   Software Development.},

   practical solutions and challenges},
Journal = {EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING},
Year = {2012},
Pages = {1-20},
Abstract = {One of the primary objectives of deploying cognitive radio (CR) within a
   dynamic spectrum access (DSA) network is to ensure that the legacy
   rights of incumbent licensed (primary) transmissions are protected with
   respect to interference mitigation when unlicensed (secondary)
   communications are ssimultaneously operating within the same spectral
   vicinity. In this article, we present non-contiguous orthogonal
   frequency division multiplexing (NC-OFDM) as a promising and practical
   approach for achieving spectrally agile wireless data transmission that
   is suitable for secondary users (SUs) to access fragmented spectral
   opportunities more efficiently. Furthermore, a review of the current
   state-of-the-art is conducted with respect to methods specifically
   designed to protect the transmissions of the primary users (PUs) from
   possible interference caused by nearby SU transceivers employing
   NC-OFDM. These methods focus on the suppression of out-of-band (OOB)
   emissions resulting from the use of NC-OFDM transmission. To achieve the
   required OOB suppression, we present two practical approaches that can
   be employed in NC-OFDM, namely, the insertion of cancellation carriers
   and windowing. In addition to the theoretical development and proposed
   improvements of these approaches the computer simulation results of
   their performance are presented. Several real-world scenarios regarding
   the coexistence of both PU and SU signals are also studied using actual
   wireless experiments based on software-defined radio. These simulation
   and experimental results indicate that OOB suppression can be achieved
   under real-world conditions, making NC-OFDM transmission a viable option
   for CR usage in DSA networks.},

Abstract = {Many firms rely on a single new-product development process for all
   projects. But designing new products for different business contexts
   requires that a firm deploy different new-product development processes.
   Products designed for stable and mature end-user markets require a
   process optimized for control and efficiency. In contrast,
   first-of-a-kind ``breakthrough{''} products require a more emergent
   process that aims to discover whether there is any market to be served
   in the first place. Applying a uniform ``best-practice{''} process to
   all development efforts ignores the major differences between these
   projects and may result in missed opportunities. This article describes
   a framework to address this problem, allowing a firm to better align the
   design of its development processes to the specific aims of individual
   projects. We illustrate this framework with examples from
   Hewlett-Packard, a large, diversified electronics firm that has
   successfully piloted this new approach across multiple business units.},

Abstract = {The Agile Software Development paradigm has become increasingly popular
   in the last few years, since it claims lower costs, better productivity,
   better quality and better business satisfaction. Supply chain management
   (SCM) is a complex software development project. Owing to its scope and
   uncertain, complex and unstable requirements, it is not possible to
   develop it with predictable software development process models. Agile
   methodologies are targeted toward such kinds of problems that involve
   change and uncertainty, and are adaptive rather than predictive. How an
   agile process is introduced will significantly impact the implementation
   success of the process change. The objective of this paper is to analyze
   the agile development methodologies and management approach used in
   developing a complex software project. This further demonstrates how to
   overcome risks and barriers in each development phase of such complex
   inventive software projects. It also provides a set of guidelines
   regarding how the agile methodologies can be adopted, combined and used
   in these kinds of complex software projects. These findings have
   implications for software engineers and managers developing software by
   agile methods. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {Context: Extreme Programming (XP) is one of the most popular agile
   software development methodologies. XP is defined as a consistent set of
   values and practices designed to work well together, but lacks practices
   for project management and especially for supporting the customer role.
   The customer representative is constantly under pressure and may
   experience difficulties in foreseeing the adequacy of a release plan.
   Objective: To assist release planning in XP by structuring the planning
   problem and providing an optimization model that suggests a suitable
   release plan.
   Method: We develop an optimization model that generates a release plan
   taking into account story size, business value, possible precedence
   relations, themes, and uncertainty in velocity prediction. The
   running-time feasibility is established through computational tests. In
   addition, we provide a practical heuristic approach to velocity
   estimation.
   Results: Computational tests show that problems with up to six themes
   and 50 stories can be solved exactly. An example provides insight into
   uncertainties affecting velocity, and indicates that the model can be
   applied in practice.
   Conclusion: An optimization model can be used in practice to enable the
   customer representative to take more informed decisions faster. This can
   help adopting XP in projects where plan-driven approaches have
   traditionally been used. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Agile methods emerge as an alternative to improve quality and
   performance in software development processes. However, as agile methods
   are essentially focused on human aspects, their application in companies
   depends mostly on their adequacy to the current organizational culture.
   This study explores the view of the organizational culture in three
   levels as a theoretical framework to allow early detection of problems,
   which could jeopardize the adoption of agile methods by a company. This
   article points out that many facilitators or obstacles to the adoption
   of an agile method can be hidden in the lower levels of the
   organizational culture. Additionally, the article shows that a
   superficial analysis of those issues can lead to a miscomprehension
   about the possibility of applying an agile method in a software company.
   This article also evidences that the interpretation of the levels of
   organizational culture improves the understanding of how an agile
   culture should be established. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {The introduction of software technology in a life-dependent environment
   requires the development team to execute a process that ensures a high
   level of software reliability and correctness. Despite their popularity,
   agile methods are generally assumed to be inappropriate as a process
   family in these environments due to their lack of emphasis on
   documentation, traceability, and other formal techniques. Agile methods,
   notably Scrum, favor empirical process control, or small constant
   adjustments in a tight feedback loop. This paper challenges the
   assumption that agile methods are inappropriate for safety-critical
   software development. Agile methods are flexible enough to encourage the
   right amount of ceremony; therefore if safety-critical systems require
   greater emphasis on activities, such as formal specification and
   requirements management, then an agile process will include these as
   necessary activities. Furthermore, agile methods focus more on
   continuous process management and code-level quality than classic
   software engineering process models. We present our experiences on the
   image-guided surgical toolkit (IGSTK) project as a backdrop. IGSTK is an
   open source software project employing agile practices since 2004. We
   started with the assumption that a lighter process is better, focused on
   evolving code, and only adding process elements as the need arose. IGSTK
   has been adopted by teaching hospitals and research labs, and used for
   clinical trials. Agile methods have matured since the academic community
   suggested almost a decade ago that they were not suitable for
   safety-critical systems; we present our experiences as a case study for
   renewing the discussion. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) demands upfront long-term
   investment in (i) designing a common set of core-assets and (ii)
   managing variability across the products from the same family. When
   anticipated changes in these core-assets have been predicted with
   certain accuracy, SPLE has proved significant improvements. However,
   when large/complex software product line projects have to deal with
   changing market conditions, alternatives to supplement SPLE are
   required. Agile Software Development (ASD) may be an alternative, as
   agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
   However, when the aim is to scale Agile projects up to effectively
   manage reusability and variability across the products from the same
   family, alternatives to supplement agility are also required. As a
   result, a new approach called Agile Product Line Engineering (APLE)
   advocates integrating SPLE and ASD with the aim of addressing these
   gaps. APLE is an emerging approach, which implies that organizations
   have to face several barriers to achieve its adoption. This paper
   presents a systematic literature review of experiences and practices on
   APLE, in which the key findings uncover important challenges about how
   to integrate the SPLE model with an agile iterative approach to fully
   put APLE into practice. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {Background: Software product lines and Agile methods have been an
   effective solution for dealing with the growing complexity of software
   and handling competitive needs of software organizations. They also
   share common goals, such as improving productivity, reducing
   time-to-market, decreasing development costs and increasing customer
   satisfaction. There has been growing interest in whether the integration
   of Agile and SPL could provide further benefits and solve many of the
   outstanding issues surrounding software development. Objective: This
   study investigates the state-of-the-art in Agile SPL approaches, while
   identifying gaps in current research and synthesizing available
   evidence. It also provides a basis for a deeper understanding of the
   issues involved in the integration of Agile and SPL. Method: A mapping
   study was undertaken to analyze the relation between Agile and SPL
   methods. A set of four research questions were defined in which the 32
   primary studies were evaluated. Results: This study provides insights
   into the integration of Agile and SPL approaches, it identifies the
   current gaps in the research, synthesize the available evidence and
   propose specific Agile methods and practices for integration in SPL.
   Conclusions: In general, few studies describe the underlying Agile
   principles being adopted by proposed Agile SPL solutions. The most
   common Agile practices proposed by the studies came from the XP and
   Scrum methods, particularly in the pro-active SPL strategy. We identify
   certain Agile methods that are being overlooked by the Agile SPL
   community, and propose specific SPL practices areas suitable for
   adoption of Agile practices. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {In 2005, the European Space Agency carried out a study intended to

   technology onboard, a need for feasibility clarification was perceived.
   The study narrowed its unbounded technological dimension by focusing on
   Java technologies. Furthermore, at a software engineering level an
   ``agile{''} approach was chosen for evaluation because of the high
   degree of user interaction and their ability to cope with general
   requirement changes like those resulting from the uncertainty about the
   actual features and quality of specific PDA platforms and COTS. Two
   studies were performed in parallel with the same objectives but
   obtaining different solutions. Suitable ``agile-like{''} approaches
   compatible with space software standards were defined and tried. A space
   crew representative was involved from the early phases of the studies,
   and a final evaluation exercise at the European Astronaut Centre
   training facilities was performed. Feedback on the suitability of the
   technologies and the MMI design choices were obtained together with
   other unexpected lessons. The paper is concluded with an enumeration of
   lessons learnt and hypotheses about ``agile{''} approaches of interest

Abstract = {In response to the rapid changes in users' requirements, a new
   generation of information systems (IS), namely, agile IS, has emerged.
   Agile IS, defined as information systems developed using agile methods,
   are characterized by frequent upgrades with a small number of new
   features released periodically. The existing research on agile IS has
   mainly focused on the developers' perspective with little research into
   end users' responses to these agile IS. Drawing upon the tripartite
   model of attitude, the status quo and the omission bias theories, and
   the availability heuristic, we propose a model that utilizes constructs
   from the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, the IS
   continuance model, habit, and individual differences to examine the
   drivers of user acceptance of agile IS. Further, we investigate not only
   users' intentions to continue using the agile IS but also their
   intentions to use new features when they are released, which is a
   surrogate for the ultimate success of agile IS. Data from 477 users of
   an agile IS showed that users' level of comfort with constant changes,
   the facilitating conditions provided, and users' habit are predictors of
   both types of intentions, with users' level of comfort with constant
   changes being the strongest predictor. Users' intentions to continue
   using agile IS are also determined by users' satisfaction with and
   perceived usefulness of the past upgrades. Finally, users who are
   innovative are more likely to use future releases of new features. The
   present work fills a gap in the software engineering literature and
   contributes a technology acceptance model specific to agile IS, which
   are becoming a mainstay of companies' IT portfolio in a fast-changing
   business environment.},

Abstract = {Context: Systems development normally takes place in a specific
   organizational context, including organizational culture. Previous
   research has identified organizational culture as a factor that
   potentially affects the deployment systems development methods.
   Objective: The purpose is to analyze the relationship between
   organizational culture and the post-adoption deployment of agile
   methods.
   Method: This study is a theory development exercise. Based on the
   Competing Values Model of organizational culture, the paper proposes a
   number of hypotheses about the relationship between organizational
   culture and the deployment: of agile methods.
   Results: Inspired by the agile methods thirteen new hypotheses are
   introduced and discussed. They have interesting implications, when
   contrasted with ad hoc development and with traditional systems
   development methods.
   Conclusion: Because of the conceptual richness of organizational culture
   and the ambiguity of the concept of agility the relationship between
   organizational culture and the deployment of agile systems development
   forms a rich and interesting research topic. Recognizing that the
   Competing Values Model represents just one view of organizational
   culture, the paper introduces a number of alternative conceptions and
   identifies several interesting paths for future research into the
   relationship between organizational culture and agile methods

Abstract = {Even though hundreds of modelling methods are in existence today,
   practitioners and researchers are zealously `producing' new modelling
   methods. The `blooming' production of modelling methods is not the
   problem; the lack of standardized techniques for evaluating them is. To
   complicate the matter even further, most of the modelling methods have
   been introduced based on common sense and intuition of the methods'
   developers. Many of these methods lack theoretical foundations and
   empirical evidence to demonstrate their worthiness. With the current
   state of affairs, studies on evaluation of modelling methods have become
   necessary and critical. Comparing modelling methods provides us with the
   necessary knowledge and understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of
   each method. This knowledge can also guide us in our quest for better

Title = {Agile methods rapidly replacing traditional methods at Nokia: A survey
   of opinions on agile transformation},
Journal = {INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {53},
Number = {3},
Pages = {276-290},

Abstract = {Context: Many organizations have started to deploy agile methods, but so
   far there exist only a few studies on organization-wide transformations.
   Are agile methods here to stay? Some claim that agile software
   development methods are in the mainstream adoption phase in the software
   industry, while others hope that those are a passing fad. The assumption
   here is that if agile would not provide real improvement, adopters would
   be eager at first but turn pessimistic after putting it into practice.
   Objective: Despite the growing amount of anecdotal evidence on the
   success of agile methods across a wide range of different real-life
   development settings, scientific studies remain scarce. Even less is
   known about the perception of the impacts of agile transformation when
   it is deployed in a very large software development environment, and
   whether agile methods are here to stay. This study aims to fill that gap
   by providing evidence from a large-scale agile transformation within
   Nokia. While we have yet to confirm these findings with solid
   quantitative data, we believe that the perception of the impacts already
   pinpoints the direction of the impacts of large-scale agile
   transformation.
   Method: The data were collected using a questionnaire. The population of
   the study contains more than 1000 respondents in seven different
   countries in Europe, North America, and Asia.
   Results: The results reveal that most respondents agree on all accounts
   with the generally claimed benefits of agile methods. These benefits
   include higher satisfaction, a feeling of effectiveness, increased
   quality and transparency, increased autonomy and happiness, and earlier
   detection of defects. Finally, 60\% of respondents would not like to
   return to the old way of working.
   Conclusion: While the perception of the impact of agile methods is
   predominantly positive, several challenge areas were discovered.
   However, based on this study, agile methods are here to stay. (C) 2010

Abstract = {Project and teamwork training is recognized as an important aspect in
   software engineering (SE) education. Senior projects, which often
   feature industrial involvement, serve the function of a `capstone
   course' in SE curricula, by offering comprehensive training in
   collaborative software development. Given the characteristics of student
   team projects and the social aspects of software development,
   instructional issues in such a course must include: how to encourage
   teamwork, how to formalize and streamline stakeholder participation, and
   how to monitor students' work, as well as sustain their desired
   collaborative effort throughout the development. In this paper, we
   present an exploratory study which highlights a particular case and
   introduces the meetings-flow approach. In order to investigate how this
   approach could contribute to the project's results, we examined its
   quantitative benefits in relation to the development of the project. We
   also conducted focus group interviews to discuss the humanistic findings
   and educational effects pertaining to this approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {Today's competitive market demands immediate attention on security
   issues for developing secure software system. Security must be an
   integral part of any application development methodology. It becomes
   more challenging when developers design projects according to agile
   methodology. Traditional ways of development are sequential considering
   major changes during analysis. Agile methodology is required as there is
   a need for an iterative approach which encourages changes in
   requirements at any stage in software development life-cycle. In this
   paper, we are presenting a framework which effectively implements
   security practices in agile development and adopts additional features
   proposed by other researchers. The key point in our framework is that we
   are embedding a hybrid technique for requirement elicitation with Agile
   Software Development (ASD). This technique would combine abuser stories
   and attack trees drawing best features of each of their individual
   methods. This hybrid technique maps security threats found during
   security requirements effectively as compared to individual techniques.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, Scrum is the most used Agile Methodology, while the
   Lean-Kanban approach is perhaps the fastest growing AM. On the other
   hand, traditional, waterfall-like approaches are still very used in
   real-life software projects, due to the ease of up-front planning and
   budgeting, that however are seldom matched upon project completion. In
   our opinion, more effort is needed to study and model the inner
   structure and behavior of these approaches, highlighting positive and
   negative feedback loops that are strategic to understand their features,
   and to decide on their adoption. In this paper we analyze the dynamic
   behavior of the adoption of Kanban and Scrum, versus a traditional
   software development process such as the Waterfall approach. We use a
   system dynamics model, based on the relationships between system
   variables, to assess the relative benefits of the studied approaches.
   The model is simulated using a commercial tool. The proposed model
   visualizes the relationships among these software development processes,
   and can be used to study their relative advantages and disadvantages.},

   its implementation harder. To use a new method, experience from other
   practitioners is critical, which describes what is important, what is

   qualitative study to understand the issues faced by early adopters in
   Malaysia where Agile methods are still relatively new. The initial study
   involves 13 participants including project managers. CEOs, founders and
   software developers from seven organisations. Our study has shown that
   social and human aspects are important when using Agile methods. While
   technical aspects have always been considered to exist in software

   the system with UML especially with UML 2.0. This article will discuss
   how to model the simple software application by using some of the
   diagrams of UML 2.0 and not by using the whole diagrams as suggested by
   agile methodology. Agile methodology is considered as convenient for
   novices because it can deliver the information technology environment to
   the end-user quickly and adaptively with minimal documentation. It also
   has the ability to deliver best performance software application

Abstract = {Proliferation and innovation of wireless technologies require
   significant amounts of radio spectrum. Recent policy reforms by the FCC
   are paving the way by freeing up spectrum for a new generation of
   frequency-agile wireless devices based on software defined radios

   protocols or applications requires an experimental platform for managing
   physical access. We introduce Papyrus, a software platform for wireless
   researchers to develop and experiment dynamic spectrum systems using
   currently available SDR hardware. Papyrus provides two fundamental
   building blocks at the physical layer: flexible non-contiguous frequency
   access and simple and robust frequency detection. Papyrus allows
   researchers to deploy and experiment new MAC protocols and applications
   on USRP GNU Radio, and can also be ported to other SDR platforms. We
   demonstrate the use of Papyrus using Jello, a distributed MAC overlay
   for high-bandwidth media streaming applications and Ganache, a SDR layer
   for adaptable guardband configuration. Full implementations of Papyrus
   and Jello are publicly available.},

Abstract = {The globalization of information technology and the improvement of
   telecommunication facilities have facilitated software development
   business processes worldwide. Despite this increasingly popular trend,
   the initial expectations of the cost reductions of offshore outsourcing
   have not been realized. Many software development companies are facing
   difficulties caused by many hidden costs, including translation efforts
   in language gap, transition risks, learning needs, communication
   overheads, setup times, ramping up durations, scope creeps, etc. In this
   paper, we propose an approach to improving knowledge sharing in global
   software development. In addition, the trend of software development
   methodology has been changing to iterative and agile style from the
   classic waterfall model. In iterative and agile software developments,
   requirement specification, coding, testing, are mainly interested in a
   relatively short term. The rationale of this change came from the higher
   software quality and higher customer satisfaction. Iterative process can
   involve customers and developers into its software development mode
   carefully and deeply. One of the challenges is to apply an iterative or
   agile development model into global software developments. The main
   problem is such iterative and agile process might need the tremendous
   number of communications and documents for collaboration because of
   iteration. Thus, software collaboration tools will be valuable for such
   situations in global software developments.},

   exchanges between blood and tissue takes place. To facilitate regular
   assessment in vivo, non-invasive microcirculation imagers are required
   in clinics. Among this group of clinical devices, are those that render
   microcirculation morphology such as nailfold capillaroscopy, a common
   device for early diagnosis and monitoring of microangiopathies. However,
   depth ambiguity disqualify this and other similar techniques in medical
   tomography where due to the 3-D nature of biological organs, imagers
   that support depth-resolved 2-D imaging and 3-D image reconstruction are
   required. Here, we introduce correlation map OCT (cmOCT), a promising
   technique for microcirculation morphology imaging that combines standard
   optical coherence tomography and an agile imaging analysis software
   based on correlation statistic. Promising results are presented of the
   microcirculation morphology images of the brain region of a small animal
   model as well as measurements of vessel geometry at bifurcations, such
   as vessel diameters, branch angles. These data will be useful for
   obtaining cardiovascular related characteristics such as volumetric
   flow, velocity profile and vessel-wall shear stress for circulatory and
   respiratory system.},

   We describe a case study that was conducted at the University of
   Ljubljana with the aim of studying the behavior of development teams
   using Scrum for the first time, i.e., a situation typical for software
   companies trying to introduce Scrum into their development process. 13
   student teams were required to develop an almost real project strictly
   using Scrum. The data on project management activities were collected in
   order to measure the amount of work completed, compliance with the
   release and iteration plans, and ability of effort estimation, thus
   contributing to evidence-based assessment of the typical Scrum
   processes. It was found that the initial plans and effort estimates were
   over-optimistic, but the abilities of estimating and planning improved
   from Sprint to Sprint. Most teams were able to define almost accurate
   Sprint plans after three Sprints. In the third Sprint the velocity
   stabilized and the actual achievement almost completely matched the
   plan. Bibl. 25, tabl. 4 (in English; abstracts in English and

Abstract = {Modern information systems, which are the result of the interconnection
   of systems of many organizations, run in variable contexts, and require
   both a lightweight approach to interoperability and the capability to
   actively react to changing requirements and failures. Model-Driven
   Development (MDD) and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) are software
   development approaches that deal with this complexity, reducing time and
   cost development and augmenting flexibility and interoperability.
   Although, requirements engineering is accepted as a critical activity in
   these approaches, there is a need to appropriately integrate and
   automate the requirements modeling and transformation tasks as part of
   MDD and SOA development approaches. Our proposal is a Rational Unified
   Process (RUP) extension, in which the requirements discipline is placed
   in a model-driven context in order to derive SOAs. This paper includes
   the definition of a model-driven requirements process including
   activities, roles, and work products.},

Abstract = {The CyberKnife system deploys a linac mounted on an agile robot and
   directed under image guidance for stereotactic radiotherapy using
   nonisocentric beam delivery. A design advantage of the CyberKnife system
   is its method of active image guidance during treatment delivery. Recent
   developments in the hardware and software of the system have
   significantly enhanced its functionality: (a) an optimized path
   traversal process significantly reduces the robot motion time, resulting
   in reductions of overall treatment times of at least 5-10 min; (b) to
   optimize the accuracy of dose calculation in CyberKnife
   planning/delivery, Monte Carlo algorithms have been introduced; (c) the
   new IRIS collimator reduces the monitor units required, increases
   treatment speed and improves conformality and homogeneity of treatment
   plans; (d) XSight lung tracking, an algorithm for fiducial-less lung
   tracking, has been developed for peripheral, radio-dense lung tumors
   with diameters > 15 mm; and (e) a sequential optimization planning
   process incorporates a more flexible approach to optimize the multiple,
   complex treatment planning criteria used today. The clinical efficacy of
   CyberKnife radiosurgery for brain/head lesions such as metastases,
   arteriovenous malformations, acoustic neuromas and meningiomas is well
   established. Since there is no need for skeletal fixation with the
   CyberKnife, radiosurgery can be applied to targets beyond the brain, and
   the technology has been extensively used for stereotactic body
   radiotherapy, treating targets in many anatomic sites. Currently,
   clinical studies have been completed or are ongoing for common
   malignancies including tumors involving the spine, lung, pancreas, liver
   and prostate. Copyright (C) 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Abstract = {Context: Although agile software development methods such as SCRUM and
   DSDM are gaining popularity, the consequences of applying agile
   principles to software product management have received little attention
   until now.
   Objective: In this paper, this gap is filled by the introduction of a
   method for the application of SCRUM principles to software product
   management. Method: A case study research approach is employed to
   describe and evaluate this method.
   Results: This has resulted in the `agile requirements refinery', an
   extension to the SCRUM process that enables product managers to cope
   with complex requirements in an agile development environment. A case
   study is presented to illustrate how agile methods can be applied to
   software product management.
   Conclusions: The experiences of the case study company are provided as a
   set of lessons learned that will help others to apply agile principles

Title = {A Business Rules Design Framework for a Pharmaceutical Validation and
   Alert System},
Journal = {METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {50},
Number = {1},
Pages = {36-50},
Abstract = {Objectives: Several alert systems have been developed to improve the
   patient safety aspects of clinical information systems (CIS). Most
   studies have focused on the evaluation of these systems, with little
   information provided about the methodology leading to system
   implementation. We propose here an `agile' business rule design
   framework (BRDF) supporting both the design of alerts for the validation
   of drug prescriptions and the incorporation of the end user into the
   design process.
   Methods: We analyzed the unified process (UP) design life cycle and
   defined the activities, subactivities, actors and UML artifacts that
   could be used to enhance the agility of the proposed framework. We then
   applied the proposed framework to two different sets of data in the
   context of the Georges Pompidou University Hospital (HEGP) CIS.
   Results: We introduced two new subactivities into UP: business rule
   specification and business rule instantiation activity. The pharmacist
   made an effective contribution to five of the eight BRDF design
   activities. Validation of the two new subactivities was effected in the
   context of drug dosage adaption to the patients' clinical and biological
   contexts. Pilot experiment shows that business rules modeled with BRDF
   and implemented as an alert system triggered an alert for 5824 of the
   71,413 prescriptions considered (8.16\%).
   Conclusion: A business rule design framework approach meets one of the
   strategic objectives for decision support design by taking into account
   three important criteria posing a particular challenge to system
   designers: 1) business processes, 2) knowledge modeling of the context
   of application, and 3) the agility of the various design steps.},

Abstract = {Contemporary middleware offers powerful abstractions to construct
   distributed software systems. However, when inspecting the software at
   run-time, these abstractions are no longer visible. While inspection,
   monitoring and management are increasingly important in our
   always-online world, they are often only possible in terms of the
   lower-level abstraction of the underlying platform. Due to the
   complexity of current programming languages and middleware, this
   low-level information is too complex to handle or understand.
   This paper presents a run-time inspection system based on dynamic model
   transformation capabilities that extends run-time entities with
   higher-level abstract views, in order to enable inspection in terms of
   the original and most relevant abstractions. Our solution is lightweight
   in terms of performance overhead and agile in the sense that it can
   selectively (and on-demand) generate these high-level views.
   Our prototype implementation has been applied to inspect distributed
   applications using RMI. In this case study, we inspect the distributed
   RMI system using our integrated overview over the collection of
   distributed objects that interact using remote method invocation.},

   conducted in March and April 2011, together with University of Antwerp,
   they evaluated the possibilities of the Normalized Systems approach for
   building information systems. In 50 man days not only a system was built
   that would normally be built in 100-150 man days, also a major
   technology change had taken place (in week 2 Cocoon and EJB2 were
   replaced by Struts and EJB3) and changes in the (data) models were
   instantly processed, even in the last week of development. With these
   results, Normalized Systems is considered a key enabler in rapid
   enterprise transformation. Moreover, because Normalized Systems makes it
   possible to have a continuous link from enterprise (process) modeling to
   software development and a short feedback loop from system development
   back to enterprise modeling, it is also considered a key enabler for
   agile enterprise engineering. This will also enable shortening the
   typical cycles of enterprise governance.},

Abstract = {Agile software development methods have attracted increasing interest in
   recent years. They hold out the promise of making software projects more
   effective by engaging more interactively with the system users and by
   reducing bureaucratic obstacles. Although users should benefit from
   systems more suited to their needs, agile methods make considerable
   demands on users during the development process. Thus agile development
   is often associated with the collocation of developers and users. This
   paper describes a study of a UK-based software development company which
   implemented a software project using the Scrum agile method in
   conjunction with a client based in Australia. The project required
   intensive, structured, communication by telephone conferences and email.
   This offered the opportunity for a researcher to observe the
   communication between the stakeholders as a silent listener at the
   telephone conferences and the recipient of copies of emails. The most
   immediate research question was whether it was possible to apply Scrum
   principles to a project where the client and user groups were split not
   just by oceans but by time zones where the duration of the shared
   working day was just one hour. This question fitted into a broader
   research agenda about the way variants of a core method may be created
   to deal with the demands of particular project contexts. As appropriate
   for a conference on research methods, this paper explains the research
   approach adopted and its practical results. It compares observation with
   other data collections methods, particularly interviewing. A key
   advantage of observation, particularly when the observer is a silent and
   invisible eavesdropper, was found to be that no demands were made on the
   hard-pressed project participants who were the subjects of the study.
   However, the approach had limitations such as the possibility of `deaf
   spots', that is, important communications taking place outside the
   hearing of the observer. With interviewing, the subjects are able to
   present explanations of their behaviour. While these may vary in
   reliability, they may be more accurate than the observer's unassisted
   interpretation of an episode.},

Abstract = {Scrum is one of the many agile approaches to software development that
   have been widely adopted over the past decade. Agile processes allow
   developers to embrace under-defined problems in complex environments
   where change in requirements is inevitable. The key agile features of
   Scrum are a flexible, adaptive schedule; democratic, collaborative
   teams; and frequent, iterative project and process reviews {[}2]. While
   students may engage with Scrum in the context of software development,
   the characteristics that suit many software problems to an agile
   approach also describe the student learning environment: complexity (new
   and unfamiliar concepts), under-defined problem space (students don't
   know what they don't know), short timeframe with frequent meetings
   (terms and class meetings), and inevitable change (apply new knowledge).
   This makes Scrum not only a software development strategy but a general
   learning strategy. Scrum facilitates frequent and iterative practice
   with timely feedback, development of mastery, and self-direction {[}1].
   In this panel, the participants will describe how their students learn
   and practice Scrum in a software development context, how they use it to
   manage student projects outside the software development context, and
   how Scrum provides opportunities to integrate communication skills into
   the Computer Science (CS) and Software Engineering (SE) curricula. As
   participants in the NSF-funded CPATH II project (NSF Grants 0939122 and
   0939081) ``Incorporating Communication Skills Throughout Computer
   Science and Software Engineering Curricula,{''} each panelist has
   developed Scrum-based assignments that exercise the skills of reading,
   writing, speaking, and teaming. The participants will discuss the design
   of these assignments and their experiences with them to date.},

Abstract = {The use of agile principles and practices in software development is
   becoming a powerful force in today's workplace. In our quest to develop
   better products, therefore, it is imperative that we strive to learn and
   understand the application of agile methods, principles and techniques
   to the software development enterprise. Unfortunately, in many
   educational institutions, courses and projects that emphasize agile
   software development are minimal. At best, students have only limited
   exposure to the agile philosophy, principles and practices at the
   graduate and undergraduate levels of education. In an effort to address
   this concern, we offered an advanced graduate-level course entitled
   ``Agile Software Engineering{''} in the Department of Computer Science
   at Virginia Tech. The primary objectives of the course were to introduce
   the values, principles and practices underlying the agile philosophy,
   and to do so in an atmosphere that encourages debate and critical
   thinking. The course was designed around three central components: (1)
   teaching the essentials of how one develops a product within an agile
   framework, (2) having invited talks by notable industry experts, and (3)
   having students present and discuss current agile research topics and
   issues. This paper describes our experiences during the offering of that
   course, and in particular, the unique perspectives of the class
   instructor, the teaching assistant and a student who was enrolled in the
   course.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the effects of agile methods and software process
   maturity on software product development performance. Through a mail
   survey, we obtained data from 72 small and medium-sized software firms
   that predominantly were not CMMI-certified. Findings from our partial
   least squares analysis suggest that the use of agile methods has a
   positive impact on product development efficiency and effectiveness, but
   CMMI practices do not have this effect. Our results suggest that
   software process improvement initiatives in software product firms
   create the highest benefits through first adopting agile methods and
   only then moving on to implementing CMMI-like process improvement
   initiatives.},

Abstract = {Global software development has changed the overall software development
   practices. It has introduced various new software development processes
   and methodologies. A new generation of processes has increasingly
   replaced the traditional software engineering practices. Emerging
   practices such as agile based methodologies, software process tailoring,
   process improvement and management approaches have gained much attention
   during the recent years. Software engineering researchers have produced
   a number of good quality works in such areas. In this paper, a review of
   major contributions of the researchers on various aspects of software
   development processes is presented. Specifically, the analysis on
   different approaches of process improvement and tailoring is critically
   discussed in the paper. This research provides guidelines to the
   researchers on future research directions. The research emphasizes on
   the need of industry oriented practical approaches of software
   development to meet the challenges of global software development.},

Abstract = {The field of mobile applications and services continues to be one of the
   most rapidly evolving areas of communications. Modeling of
   domain-dependent aspects is a key prerequisite for the design of
   software for mobile systems. Most mobile systems include a more or less
   advanced model of selected aspects of the domain in which they are used.
   However, the traditional development approach to business applications,
   data base and general software is not suitable for mobile devices of the
   different paradigms. In this paper, we discuss the creation of such a
   model and its relevance for technical design of mobile software
   applications. The paper also reports from an empirical study where a
   methodology that combines both of these approaches was introduced and
   employed for modeling of the domain-dependent aspects that were relevant
   for the design of a mobile software component. The resulting models of
   domain-dependent aspects are presented. and the experiences from the
   modeling process are discussed. It strongly focus on the lightweight
   mobile service oriented common framework architectures for business
   applications running on mobile devices. It is concluded that a dual
   perspective based on both of the conventional approaches is relevant for
   capturing the aspects that are necessary for creating the
   domain-dependent models that are integrated in a mobile software system.
   As an architect, you are often challenged - by client enterprise
   architects and IT stakeholders - to articulate Service-Oriented
   Architecture (SOA) patterns and service components in a nonproprietary,
   product-agnostic way. In this paper, use Unified Modeling Language (UML)
   models to describe the SOA architecture pattern and its associated
   service components. You also learn about the service components of the
   SOA pattern in the context of industry-standard UML formats to help
   stakeholders to better understand the components that constitute an SOA.},

   A catalog of Agile Systems Engineering success factors also lists
   ``flexible product (line) architecture{''}. Being counterintuitive at
   first sight, the relation between these agile success factors and
   Software Product Lines (SPL) is discussed. Equally well, the concepts of
   SPL are mapped to a top-down Systems Engineering (SE) approach as
   possible SE implementation approach.
   A closer look at these mappings reveals what we call an agile continuum.
   It represents a time line of binding times in an SPL from domain
   definition time to runtime. Binding of variability can occur at any of
   these times. It has been named a continuum, as there is no clear point
   in time, when the product line process is finished and the product life
   cycle starts. In this respect, the concepts of ``flexible product
   lines{''} (processes) and ``flexible products{''} form a continuous

Abstract = {While Requirements Engineering textbooks state that a requirements

   The software development community has solved a similar problem (not

   introducing agile development methods, which offer ways of segmenting
   the overall project, and choosing which parts to allocate resources to.
   This paper is about how insights from that agile development community
   can be applied to requirements engineering activities for any (agile or
   non-agile) development project. Key terms in agile development, such as
   ``working product{''} and ``user story{''}, must be mapped intelligently
   to terms in requirements engineering - and not simply copied: the
   ``product{''} of requirements engineering is not the same as the
   ``product{''} being implemented by developers.},

   transformations to a program with the objective of improving the

   that need to be performed.
   Tool support for refactoring is essential because checking the
   preconditions of refactoring often requires nontrivial program analysis,
   and applying transformations may affect many locations throughout a
   program. In recent years, the emergence of light-weight programming
   methodologies such as Extreme Programming has generated a great amount
   of interest in refactoring, and refactoring support has become a
   required feature in today's IDEs.
   This workshop is a continuation of a series of previous workshops (ECOOP
   2007, OOPSLA 2008 and 2009 - see http://refactoring.info/WRT) where
   researchers and developers of refactoring tools can meet and discuss

   are faced with a challenge to quickly assimilate the mindset of these
   new methods and develop the ability to recognize information and apply
   it in context. This paper reports on two ex-post ISD project
   implementation. We integrate a central construct in the dynamic
   capability theory - absorptive capacity to explain agile method adoption

Abstract = {Cognitive radios are becoming the technological foundation for
   efficiently managing the scarcity of wireless spectrum, fulfilling
   various QoS demands and allowing different networks to coexist.
   Cognition and spectrum agility in MAC protocols require adaptability and
   close PHY-MAC interaction. Classically, MAC protocols have been
   implemented in hardware, which gives a limited possibility for
   reconfiguration and customization. Recently, software based MAC
   implementations have emerged although a close hardware-software
   co-design is typically required to keep the time critical operations in
   ASICs or FPGAs. We introduce a MAC development framework for enabling
   fast composition of MAC protocols, which are best fitted to the
   application requirements, communication capabilities of the radio, and
   current spectrum regulations and policies. We decompose MAC protocols
   into their basic functionalities which are perceived as building blocks
   and are partitioned across hardware/software. Our framework allows
   on-the-fly realization of the envisioned MAC protocol through wiring of
   these fundamental components. By exposing extended meta-data and
   hardware functionalities for the MAC implementation through our granular
   components, together with the support for run-time re-configuration,
   spectrum agile and cognitive MAC solutions can be easily realized. In
   this paper, we describe the design rationale and implementation details
   of our framework on WARP {[}1] boards. We show through experimental
   evaluation that the framework provides flexible means for prototyping
   different reconfigurable cognitive and spectrum agile MAC protocols.},

Abstract = {China has been greatly engaging in global outsourcing services. Despite
   the increase in global outsourcing services, the nature of partnerships
   involved between China's providers and their overseas clients have not
   received adequate attention in the scholarly literature. In this paper,
   we analyze three possible types of outsourcing networks partnership:
   tactical, strategic and transformational partnership. Based on software
   development ``waterfall model{''}, we explain the provider's role of
   China in software outsourcing networks and find it is in the tactical
   partnership. We conclude that China's low value chain in software
   outsourcing networks are decided by the tactical partnership. Finally,
   we give some suggestions on how to improve China's software outsourcing
   industry.},

Title = {The effect of moving from a plan-driven to an incremental software
   development approach with agile practices},
Journal = {EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {15},
Number = {6},
Pages = {654-693},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {So far, only few in-depth studies focused on the direct comparison of
   process models in general, and between plan-driven and incremental/agile
   approaches in particular. That is, it is not made explicit What the
   effect is of moving from one model to another model. Furthermore, there
   is limited evidence on advantages and issues encountered in agile
   software development, this is specifically true in the context of
   large-scale development. The objective of the paper is to investigate
   how the perception of bottlenecks, unnecessary work, and rework (from
   hereon referred to as issues) changes when migrating from a plan-driven
   to an incremental software development approach with agile practices
   (flexible product backlog, face-to-face interaction, and frequent
   integration), and how commonly perceived these practices are across
   different systems and development roles. The context in which the
   objective should be achieved is large-scale development with a
   market-driven focus. The selection of the context was based on the
   observation in related work that mostly small software development
   projects were investigated and that the investigation was focused on one
   agile model (eXtreme programming). A case study was conducted at a
   development site of Ericsson AB, located in Sweden in the end of 2007.
   In total 33 interviews were conducted in order to investigate the
   perceived change when migrating from plan-driven to incremental and
   agile software development, the interviews being the primary source of
   evidence. For triangulation purposes measurements collected by Ericsson
   were considered, the measurements relating to unnecessary work (amount
   of discarded requirements) and rework (data on testing efficiency and
   maintenance effort). Triangulation in this context means that the
   measurements were used to confirm the perceived changes with an
   additional data source. In total 64 issues were identified, 24 being of
   general nature and the remaining 40 being local and therefore unique to
   individual's opinions or a specific system. The most common ones were
   documented and analyzed in detail. The commonality refers to how many
   persons in different roles and across the systems studied have mentioned
   the issues for each of the process models. The majority of the most
   common issues relates to plan-driven development. We also identified
   common issues remaining for agile after the migration, which were
   related to testing lead-time, test coverage, software release, and
   coordination overhead. Improvements were identified as many issues
   commonly raised for the plan-driven approach were not raised anymore for
   the incremental and agile approach. It is concluded that the recent
   introduction (start in 2005 with the study being conducted in the end of
   2007) of incremental and agile practices brings added values in
   comparison to the plan-driven approach, which is evident from the
   absence of critical issues that are encountered in plan-driven
   development.},

Journal = {REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERING},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {375-396},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {It is essential for product software companies to decide which
   requirements should be included in the next release and to make an
   appropriate time plan of the development project. Compared to the
   extensive research done on requirement selection, very little research
   has been performed on time scheduling. In this paper, we introduce two
   integer linear programming models that integrate time scheduling into
   software release planning. Given the resource and precedence
   constraints, our first model provides a schedule for developing the
   requirements such that the project duration is minimized. Our second
   model combines requirement selection and scheduling, so that it not only
   maximizes revenues but also simultaneously calculates an
   on-time-delivery project schedule. Since requirement dependencies are
   essential for scheduling the development process, we present a more
   detailed analysis of these dependencies. Furthermore, we present two
   mechanisms that facilitate dynamic adaptation for over-estimation or
   under-estimation of revenues or processing time, one of which includes
   the Scrum methodology. Finally, several simulations based on real-life
   data are performed. The results of these simulations indicate that
   requirement dependency can significantly influence the requirement
   selection and the corresponding project plan. Moreover, the model for
   combined requirement selection and scheduling outperforms the sequential
   selection and scheduling approach in terms of efficiency and on-time
   delivery.},

Title = {Introducing knowledge redundancy practice in software development:
   Experiences with job rotation in support work},
Journal = {INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {52},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1118-1132},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Context: Job rotation is a widely known approach to increase knowledge
   redundancy but empirical evidence regarding introduction and adoption in
   software development is scant. A lack of knowledge redundancy is a
   limiting factor for collaboration, flexibility, and coordination within
   teams and within the organization.
   Objective: The scientific objective of this investigation was to explore
   benefits and challenges with improving knowledge redundancy among
   developers participating in job rotation. There were two practical
   objectives; (a) to establish customer support as a legitimate
   organizational function that would shield developers from support
   enquiries, and (b) to contribute to improved flexibility in project
   staffing by enabling overlapping product experience among developers.
   Method: We used action research to integrate organizational change with
   scientific inquiry. During a period of eighteen weeks, nine developers
   rotated to customer support. We collected data throughout the period of
   collaboration: in meetings, from comprehensive interviews, and from
   customer support work logs.
   Results: Perceptions of reduced efficiency and unnecessary redundancy
   outweighed benefits of shielding and learning about different products.
   Although there were strong indications of increased knowledge
   redundancy, the benefits were not sufficient to justify job rotation.
   Job rotation was abandoned after the trial period.
   Conclusions: Job rotation can contribute to improved knowledge
   redundancy. Benefits of knowledge redundancy include innovation stemming
   from integration of different knowledge domains and improved
   appreciation of organizational concerns. However, knowledge redundancy
   incurs a collective cost that must be amortized and legitimized by the
   organization. An adoption process that accommodates open and trustful
   discussion among all involved stakeholders is therefore encouraged. (C)

Abstract = {For software process improvement - SPI - there are few small
   organizations using models that guide the management and deployment of
   their improvement initiatives. This is largely because a lot of these
   models do not consider the special characteristics of small businesses,
   nor the appropriate strategies for deploying an SPI initiative in this
   type of organization. It should also be noted that the models which
   direct improvement implementation for small settings do not present an
   explicit process with which to organize and guide the internal work of
   the employees involved in the implementation of the improvement
   opportunities. In this paper we propose a lightweight process, which
   takes into account appropriate strategies for this type of organization.
   Our proposal, known as a ``Lightweight process to incorporate
   improvements{''}, uses the philosophy of the Scrum agile method, aiming
   to give detailed guidelines for supporting the management and
   performance of the incorporation of improvement opportunities within
   processes and their putting into practice in small companies. We have
   applied the proposed process in two small companies by means of the case
   study research method, and from the initial results, we have observed
   that it is indeed suitable for small businesses. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Number = {4},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {Agile software development methods have proven to be a substantial
   catalyst for improvements in software quality, speed of delivery, and
   fitness for use, and are a driver behind the IBM Smarter Planet (TM)
   initiative, which involves intelligent approaches that address the needs
   of a world that is becoming increasingly interconnected and
   instrumented. Software vendors who use a traditional or waterfall
   approach (i.e., sequential software development process) for requirement
   analysis and development often find that they cannot react with
   sufficient speed to meet rapidly changing market demand. As a result,
   stakeholders must wait for the vendor to complete a lengthy development
   cycle, which, when complete, may miss the market window for the software
   or fail to adequately address other needs of these stakeholders. Agile
   development methods, as practiced across geographically diverse and
   broad development teams at IBM, directly address this issue. One purpose
   of this paper is simply to provide a brief high-level overview and
   record of the adoption of these practices and methods across a large

Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {219-249},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {To be relevant to the goals of an enterprise, an industrial software
   engineering research organization must identify problems of interest to,
   and find solutions that have an impact on, the software development
   organizations within the company. Using a systematic measurement program
   both to identify the problems and assess the impact of solutions is key
   to satisfying this need. Avaya has had such a program in place for about
   seven years. Every year we produce an annual report known as the State
   of Software in Avaya that describes software development trends
   throughout the company and that contains prioritized recommendations for
   improving Avaya's software development capabilities. We start by
   identifying the goals of the enterprise and use the goal-question-metric
   approach to identify the measures to compute. The result is insight into
   the enterprise's problems in software development, recommendations for
   improving the development process, and problems that require research to
   solve. We will illustrate the process with examples from the Software
   Technology Research Department in Avaya Labs whose purpose is to improve
   the state of software development and know it. ``Know it{''} means that
   improvement should be subjectively evident and objectively quantifiable.
   ``Know it{''} also means that one must be skilled at identifying the
   data sources, performing the appropriate analyses to answer the
   questions of interest, and validating that the data are accurate and
   appropriate for the purpose. Examples will include how and why we
   developed a measure of software quality that appeals to customers, how
   and why we are studying the effectiveness of distributed software
   development, and how and why we are helping development organizations to
   adopt iterative development methods. We will also discuss how we keep
   the company and the department apprised of the current strengths and
   weaknesses of software development in Avaya through the publication of
   the annual State of Software in Avaya Report. Our purpose is both to
   provide a model for assessment that others may emulate, based on seven
   years of experience, and to spotlight analyses and conclusions that we
   feel are common to software development today.},

   Method We conducted extensive fieldwork for 0 months in a software

   Results We describe a project through Dickinson and McIntyre's teamwork
   model, focusing on the interrelations between essential teamwork
   components Problems with team orientation, team leadership and
   coordination in addition to highly specialized skills and corresponding
   division of work were important barriers for achieving team
   effectiveness
   Conclusion Transitioning from individual work to self-managing teams
   requires a reorientation not only by developers but also by management
   This transition takes time and resources, but should not be neglected In
   addition to Dickinson and McIntyre's teamwork components, we found trust
   and shared mental models to be of fundamental importance (C) 2009

Abstract = {As business and technology environments change at an unprecedented rate,
   software development agility to respond to changing user requirements
   has become increasingly critical for software development performance.
   Agile software development approaches, which emphasize
   sense-and-respond, self-organization, cross-functional teams, and
   continuous adaptation, have been adopted by an increasing number of
   organizations to improve their software development agility. However,
   the agile development literature is largely anecdotal and prescriptive,
   lacking empirical evidence and theoretical foundation to support the
   principles and practices of agile development. Little research has
   empirically examined the software development agility construct in terms
   of its dimensions, determinants, and effects on software development
   performance. As a result, there is a lack of understanding about how
   organizations can effectively implement an agile development approach.
   Using an integrated research approach that combines quantitative and
   qualitative data analyses, this research opens the black box of agile
   development by empirically examining the relationships among two
   dimensions of software development agility (software team response
   extensiveness and software team response efficiency), two antecedents
   that can be con trolled (team autonomy and team diversity), and three
   aspects of software development performance (on-time completion,
   on-budget completion, and software functionality). Our PLS results of
   survey, responses of 399 software project managers suggest that the
   relationships among these variables are more complex than what has been
   perceived by the literature. The results suggest a tradeoff relationship
   between response extensiveness and response efficiency. These two
   agility dimensions impact software development performance differently:
   response efficiency positively affects all of on-time completion,
   on-budget completion, and software functionality, whereas response
   extensiveness positively affects only software functionality. The
   results also suggest that team autonomy has a positive effect on
   response efficiency and a negative effect on response extensiveness, and
   that team diversity has a positive effect on response extensiveness, We
   conducted 10 post hoc case studies to qualitatively cross-validate our
   PLS results and provide rich, additional insights regarding the complex,
   dynamic interplays between autonomy, diversity, agility, and
   performance. The qualitative analysis also provides explanations for
   both supported and unsupported hypotheses. We discuss these qualitative
   analysis results and conclude with the theoretical and practical
   implications of our research findings for agile development approaches.},

Abstract = {The agile approach for software development has attracted a great deal
   of interest in both academic and industry communities in the last
   decade. Nevertheless the wide adoption of agile methods in ever growing
   number of software development projects, shifting the development
   process of an organization to an agile one is not straightforward.
   Certain considerations for the applicability of agile practices should
   be taken into account when this transition is performed. In this paper,
   an approach for situational engineering of agile methods is proposed.
   The approach is based on the experience gained in adopting agile
   practices in both internal and external projects of organizations. A
   knowledge-base supporting the selection of agile practices that are
   suitable for certain project is introduced. Automated generation of
   appropriate software development process is included as well. Particular
   realization of the approach supported by SPEM-based tools is also
   presented in the paper.},

Abstract = {Despite advances in situational method engineering, many software
   organizations continue to adopt an ad-hoc mix of method fragments from
   well-known development methods such as Scrum or XP, based on their
   perceived suitability to project or organizational needs. With the
   increasing availability of empirical evidence on the success or failure
   of various software development methods and practices under different
   situational conditions, it now becomes feasible to make this evidence
   base systematically accessible to practitioners so that they can make
   informed decisions when creating situational methods for their
   organizations. This paper proposes a framework for evaluating the
   suitability of candidate method fragments prior to their adoption in
   software projects. The framework makes use of collected knowledge about
   how each method fragment can contribute to various project objectives,
   and what requisite conditions must be met for the fragment to be
   applicable. Pre-constructed goal models for the selected fragments are
   retrieved from a repository, merged, customized with situational
   factors, and then evaluated using a qualitative evaluation procedure
   adapted from goal-oriented requirements engineering.},

Abstract = {Specialist organizational environments and lack of redundant knowledge
   reduce flexibility and therefore inhibits transition to agile
   development. This action research reports from the adoption of team
   estimation as a vehicle to increase redundant knowledge within a group
   of specialists. The group suffered from low levels of group learning
   legitimized by high work pressure and a specialist organizational
   environment. This resulted in poor planning and optimistic task
   estimates which contributed to increase the work pressure even higher. I
   framed the research as double-loop learning; I illustrate how different
   barriers to team estimation arose from conflicts with existing
   efficiency norms and then how benefits from team estimation created
   sufficient momentum to change practice. The results are obtained from
   qualitative analysis of empirical data gathered during one year of
   collaboration with the group. The article contributes to understanding
   of barriers to group learning and agile adoption in software
   organizations(1).},

Abstract = {Software product lines - families of similar but not identical software
   products - need to address the issue of feature variability. That is, a
   single feature might require various implementations for different
   customers. Also, features might need optional extensions that are needed
   by some but not all products. Software product line engineering manages
   variability by conducting a thorough domain analysis upfront during the
   planning phases. However, upfront, heavyweight planning approaches are
   not well-aligned with the values of minimalistic practices like XP where
   bottom-up, incremental development is common. In this paper, we
   introduce a bottom-up, test-driven approach to introduce variability to
   systems by reactively refactoring existing code. We support our approach
   with an eclipse plug-in to automate the refactoring process. We evaluate
   our approach by a case study to determine the feasibility and
   practicality of the approach.},

   a large multisite organization during the first six months of agile
   transformation. Defect data was compared to the results of a survey on
   agile transformation experiences and perceptions, which was conducted in
   the organization six months after starting the agile transformation.
   According to the results, improvements were visible in the defect data,
   but less than 25\% of the people in the organization felt that quality
   had improved. Further study revealed that a realistic perception of the
   positive changes in the defect data coincided with positive emotional
   engagement in agile transformation.},

   the quality of the product and the productivity of the process? We
   answer to these questions by identifying a set of measures and by
   comparing the data we collected before and after the introduction of

   an ongoing geographically distributed Open Source Software process and
   that it helps control the development process better.},

Abstract = {Scrum was trialed at Cimex - a Digital Media Agency in the UK. Our
   insights centre in particular around the close interactions between the
   designers and developer working in the same room, and how the design
   roles were played out in the Scrum context. The lessons learned from
   this experience are now presented to our clients as a case study in
   order to make them more aware of the benefits of running an Agile
   project. Since this trial, we have adapted our current practice to
   include more immediate forms of communication. We now have hands-on
   experience integrating design with Scrum and can say that it was an
   enjoyable, bonding experience for the team.},

Abstract = {Pair programming, two programmers collaborating on design, coding and
   testing, has been a controversial focus of interest as Agile Software
   Development continues to grow in popularity both among academics and
   practitioners. As a result of the many investigations into the
   effectiveness of pair programming in the last decade, many have come to
   realize that there are many hard-to-control factors in pair programming
   in particular and in empirical software engineering in general. Because
   of these factors, the results of many pair programming experiments are
   not easy to replicate and the relative productivity of pair and solo
   programming are still not fully understood. So far, it has been
   concluded by previous studies that pair programming productivity can
   vary, but few have shown how and why this is the case. In this chapter,
   we discuss a number of challenging factors in the adoption of pair
   programming and present an approach to deal with them. We discuss how
   different factors may affect our experimental outcomes and improve
   experiment design to reveal how and why pair programming can be made
   productive, at least, in controlled situations.},

Abstract = {Systems are becoming increasingly reliant on software due to needs for
   rapid fielding of ``70\% capabilities,{''} interoperability,
   net-centricity, and rapid adaptation to change. The latter need has led
   to increased interest in agile methods of software development, in which
   teams rely on shared tacit interpersonal knowledge rather than explicit
   documented knowledge. However, such systems often need to be scaled up
   to higher level of performance and assurance, requiring stronger
   architectural support. Several organizations have recently transformed
   themselves by developing successful combinations of agility and
   architecture that can scale to projects of up to 100 personnel. This
   chapter identifies a set of key principles for such architected agile
   solutions for software-reliant systems, provides guidance for how much
   architecting is enough, and illustrates the key principles with several
   case studies.},

Abstract = {A particular strength of agile approaches is that they move away from
   `introverted' development and intimately involve the customer in all
   areas of development, supposedly leading to the development of a more
   innovative and hence more valuable information system. However, we argue
   that a single customer representative is too narrow a focus to adopt and
   that involvement of stakeholders beyond the software development itself
   is still often quite weak and in some cases non-existent. In response,
   we argue that current thinking regarding innovation in agile development
   needs to be extended to include multiple stakeholders outside the
   business unit. This paper explores the intra-organisational
   applicability and implications of open innovation in agile systems
   development. Additionally, it argues for a different perspective of
   project management that includes collaboration and knowledge-sharing
   with other business units, customers, partners, and other relevant
   stakeholders pertinent to the business success of an organisation, thus
   embracing open innovation principles.},

   based software engineering that embodies high degree of dynamism both at

   main contribution of this paper is a novel approach that is influenced
   by business innovation, human centered design, model driven development
   and ontology oriented design. The approach is called Ontology driven
   Piecemeal Software Engineering (OPSE). OPSE facilitates incremental
   software development based on software pieces that follow the design

Abstract = {Nowadays collaboration among organizations in the so called Virtual
   Organizations (VOs) is the most advanced form to make business. Their
   emergence and growing are closely related to integrated information and
   communication technology (ICT). One of the promising approaches to carry
   out the agility and flexibility in VO creation is defined under the
   assumption of a VO Breeding Environment (VBE). To support such agile
   organizations, an efficient IT system and methodologies should be set in
   order to facilitate their daily management activities. Service-oriented
   software technologies provide promising means to regulate and enforce
   coordination of cross-organisational business services interactions but
   lack organizational abstractions and methodology. This paper proposes a
   framework for collaborative network coordination in the VBEs's context.
   The proposed framework satisfies flexibility and agility requirements of
   virtual organization using a multi layer approach combining VBE
   management systems layer that assist flexible VO creation, a semantic
   interoperability layer essential for promoting integration on the basis
   of common language that describe VO concepts and inherent dependencies,
   and a service oriented layer that introduces the concept of service
   domain that encapsulates business processes fitting VO requirements.},

Abstract = {Providing current, time-sensitive imagery and geospatial information to

   challenge. This challenge is compounded through rapid increases in
   sensor collection volumes, both with larger arrays and higher temporal

   responders, ITT developed a system called AGILE (Advanced Geospatial
   Imagery Library Enterprise) Access as an innovative approach based on
   standard off-the-shelf techniques to solving this problem. The AGILE
   Access system is based on commercial software called Image Access
   Solutions (IAS) and incorporates standard JPEG 2000 processing. Our
   solution system is implemented in an accredited, deployable form,
   incorporating a suite of components, including an image database, a
   web-based search and discovery tool, and several software tools that act
   in concert to process, store, and disseminate imagery from airborne
   systems and commercial satellites. Currently, this solution is
   operational within the U. S. Government tactical infrastructure and
   supports disadvantaged imagery users in the field. This paper presents
   the features and benefits of this system to disadvantaged users as
   demonstrated in real-world operational environments.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, various user-centered and participatory design methodologies
   with different degree of agility are followed when building
   sophisticated socio-technical systems. Even when applying these methods,
   non-functional requirements (NFRs) are often considered too late in the

   developers' needs remains mostly neglected. Furthermore, there is a
   conceptual lack of guidance and support for efficiently fulfilling NFRs
   in terms of software architecture in general. This paper aims at
   introducing the AFFINE framework simultaneously addressing these needs
   with (1) conceptually considering NFRs early in the development process,
   (2) explicitly balancing end-users' with developers' needs, and (3) a
   reference architecture providing support for NFRs. Constitutive
   requirements for AFFINE were gathered based on experiences from various
   projects on designing and implementing groupware systems.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the question if Scrum and XP is well suited for
   development of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) software. The
   reason for choosing Scrum and XP is based on two facts. Firstly, CSE
   developers are not used to formal processes for software development and
   Scrum and XP are informal in nature, hence easier to adopt. Secondly CSE
   projects are often once-off and aimed at producing scientific results
   rather than commercial software, so the overhead of a process or
   methodology needs to be kept at a minimum. Scrum and XP are focused on
   producing software, thus keeping everything else, i.e. the overhead to a
   minimum, a fact that benefits CSE development. In this article, the
   characteristics of Scrum and XP in particular and agile development in
   general are evaluated against the needs of CSE developers. The results
   show that almost all the key points in both methodologies are well
   suited for CSE development and that agile development in general is a
   good match with CSE. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {In the face of globalization, with the rapid pace at which the very
   nature of warfighting is changing, and with ever-increasing rates of
   technological innovation, much attention has been given in recent years
   to transforming traditional systems engineering and standard acquisition
   paradigms to meet these challenges. We argue that, by applying
   principles from agile software development, which has achieved strong
   success in recent years, there is great potential to meet these
   challenges directly and, in doing so, to save money, increase
   efficiency, and ensure that the right decisions are being made as
   systems are developed and deployed. Furthermore, we suggest that this
   movement to ``agile systems engineering{''} can largely be accomplished
   by employing systems engineering practices that are centered on
   evolutionary, end-to-end implementations of physics-based modeling and
   simulation. Finally, we argue that the DoD must have qualified,
   independent, trusted agents that will help it execute these improved
   systems engineering practices if it is to be successful.},

Abstract = {Agile development methods such as extreme programming (XP), SCRUM, Lean
   Software Development (Lean SD) and others have gained much popularity
   during the last years. Agile methodologies promise faster
   time-to-market, satisfied customers and high quality software. While
   these prospects are appealing, the suitability of agile practices to
   different domains and business contexts still remains unclear. In this
   article we investigate the applicability of agile principles in the
   context of market-driven software product development (MDPD), focusing
   on pre-project activities. This article presents results of a comparison
   between typical properties of agile methods to the needs of MDPD, as
   well as findings of a case study conducted at Ericsson, an early adopter
   of agile product development. The results show misalignment between the
   agile principles and needs of pre-project activities in market-driven
   development. This misalignment threatens to subtract from the positive
   aspects of agile development, but maybe more importantly, threaten the
   overall product development by disabling effective product management.

   the data. The data were collected using two questionnaires. The
   population of the first study contains more than 100 respondents from
   three different continents (Europe, North America, and Asia) and seven
   different countries and the second study 500 respondents from the same
   organization. The results reveal that most respondents are satisfied
   agile way of working and would like to stay in agile mode. They also
   think using agile methods is important for the future. In two

Abstract = {Choosing the appropriate software development methodology is something
   which continues to occupy the minds of many IT professionals. The
   introduction of ``Agile{''} development methodologies such as XP and
   SCRUM held the promise of improved software quality and reduced delivery
   times. Combined with a Lean philosophy, there would seem to be potential
   for much benefit. While evidence does exist to support many of the
   Lean/Agile claims, we look here at how such methodologies are being
   adopted in the rigorous environment of safety-critical embedded software
   development due to its high regulation. Drawing on the results of a
   systematic literature review we find that evidence is sparse for
   Lean/Agile adoption in these domains. However, where it has been
   trialled, ``out-of-the-box{''} Agile practices do not seem to fully suit
   these environments but rather tailored Agile versions combined with more
   plan-based practices seem to be making inroads.},

Abstract = {The current trends in most software development organizations are in
   striving for high performance while meeting the emergent and even
   rapidly changing customer needs. Traditional product development models
   are often ineffective in such respects. Now Lean and Agile software
   models address many of those particular concerns. However, empirical
   evidence of their actual performance effects is still scarce and
   probably many hidden inefficiencies exist in practical software
   projects. For example the Kanban process model is one of the latest
   proposals with apparent potential to improve the efficiency of the
   projects. This paper explores how software development activities and
   process improvement can be evaluated in such cases. A research model is
   constructed for the purpose of this investigation. New research
   hypotheses can be derived and tested empirically with case study
   projects. By applying the supported hypotheses in practice, the model is
   intended to be a systematic performance development vehicle for software
   projects and a provisional framework for the Lean software enterprise
   transformation research and development.},

Abstract = {The Beyond Budgeting performance management model enables companies to
   keep pace with changing environments, to quickly create and adapt
   strategy and to empower people throughout the organisation to make
   effective choices. We argue that this performance management model may
   be ideal for agile software development. Although drawn from different
   disciplines, both are designed for a customer-orientated, fast-changing
   operating environment and the Beyond Budgeting model suggests a useful
   overall framework for research in the performance management of agile
   software development teams. This paper uses the model as a lens to
   examine the performance management of agile software development teams
   within a large multinational. The findings show that some traditional
   performance management processes (most notably the budgeting process),
   which were designed to aid in the performance management of software
   development teams may impede the performance of agile teams due to their
   suitability adherence to the requirements of the systems development
   lifecycle model.},

Abstract = {The Agile movement started a transition in the software industry. Some
   say that Agile brings more professionalism to the industry by focusing
   on the core activities and calling for a redesign of our software
   development processes in a fundamentally different way. However, it is
   clear that as Agile gets adopted, not everything is a bed of roses. Many
   companies are faced with issues that the available Agile methods do not
   sufficiently address. Lean is another paradigm that is gathering
   momentum and, according to many, can be the ``next step{''} for the
   agile methods to step out of the software development environment and
   step into the larger business context of our industry. Some of the
   questions we intend to frame in this panel are: Why have companies
   embraced Agile? Why have companies embraced Lean? What do each of these
   paradigms agree on and what are the divergences? Why are those
   divergences important? What does the Lean paradigm change for a software
   company that has embraced Agile in the past?},

Title = {An Agile approach to library IT innovations},
Journal = {LIBRARY HI TECH},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {672-689},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper seeks to describe the application of the Agile
   software development approach to rapidly develop and deploy a variety of
   innovative IT applications.
   Design/methodology/approach - The Agile approach is flexible and
   iterative with continuous feedback and constant communication. It is
   also marked by frequent and short delivery schedules. An Agile team of
   staff and students was formed for different projects, and visual tools
   were used to show process and progress. Team members were also
   co-located (situated in the same space), a key element that allowed
   faster and direct communication. Within the Agile framework, the Crystal
   Clear methodology was selected, which is based on team size and
   criticality of the application to develop the workflow and iterative
   processes.
   Findings - The Agile approach is particularly suited to innovation
   development and creative teams for rapid development of products,
   services, and technology. However, its acceptance is dependent on
   organizational culture and nature of application.
   Research limitations/implications - As a next step, it would be useful
   to test the Agile approach in an innovative application that is on a
   larger scale than six team members and with a different level of
   criticality.
   Practical implications - Flexibility and adaptability are needed in
   managing the development of IT innovations and applications as they vary
   in size and complexity. The flexible and iterative Agile approach
   provided the framework to develop and implement these projects despite
   the small staff size.
   Originality/value - There is little in the professional literature on
   software development and project management approaches for small teams.
   The Agile approach would be of interest to an IT unit or library with
   limited staff resources and interested in a lightweight framework to
   develop and deploy innovative projects.},

   is to adopt the view of documentation as boundary objects: shared
   artefacts that maintain integrity across a project's intersecting social
   worlds. The paper presents a case study, in which interviews with system
   engineers and designers were analysed to obtain requirements on an
   architectural description serving as boundary objects in a
   telecommunications project. The main result is a list of 18 empirically
   grounded, elementary requirements, worth considering when implementing
   lean and agile processes in the large.},

Abstract = {Despite the prevalence of agile methods, few software companies adopt a
   prescribed agile process in its entirety. For many practitioners, agile
   software development is about picking up fragments from various agile
   methods, assembling them as a light-weight process, and deploying them
   in their software projects. Given the growing number of published
   empirical studies about using agile in different project situations, it
   is now possible to gain a more realistic view of what each agile method
   fragment can accomplish, and the necessary requisites for its successful
   deployment. With the aim of making this knowledge more accessible, this
   paper introduces a repository of agile method fragments, which organizes
   the evidential knowledge according to their objectives and requisites.
   The knowledge is gathered through systematic review of empirical studies
   which investigated the enactment of agile methods in various project
   situations. In addition, the paper proposes a modeling paradigm for
   visualizing the stored knowledge of method fragments, to facilitate the
   subsequent assembly task.},

Abstract = {Global Software Development (GSD) is a growing sector in Mauritius and
   South Africa (SA). With an increasing number of Information Technology
   (IT) investors, both countries are recognised as IT hubs in the Southern
   African region. Furthermore, due to a diverse cultural setting
   prevailing in Mauritius and SA, particular software development methods
   which are in concurrence with those cultures might be employed. It is
   thus useful to explore how existing software development methods,
   particularly the Waterfall and the Rational Unified Process (RUP) might
   be employed in these cultural. The research method adopted for the study
   was qualitative and empirical in nature. Multiple case studies were
   conducted in Mauritius and SA and data was collected through
   semi-structured interviews. The data collection and analysis processes
   were guided by the Grounded Theory techniques due to the limited number
   of GSD studies conducted in the Mauritian and SA contexts. Based on the
   results, the paper posits that companies engaging themselves in GSD in
   Mauritius and SA are adapting software development methods (Waterfall
   and RUP) to fit their cultural needs. In essence, the methods employed
   blend some form of flexibility and rigour to drive GSD projects towards
   success. The software development methods are thus employed to mitigate
   cultural issues. Another major outcome of this study is that GSD teams
   have a direct impact on the effective use of the software development
   methods. For instance, the level of skills of the GSD team members
   impacts on the effective application of the software development methods
   during the GSD projects. Results of this study might thus be useful to
   practitioners wishing to engage in GSD in Mauritius and SA, by providing
   guidance on how best to employ software development methods to achieve
   GSD success.},

Abstract = {Nowadays the software industry is applying agile methods widely.
   However, there appears to be a lack of comprehensive guidelines and
   strategies addressing agile adoption. In addition, agile methods and
   practices often have to be tailored to be integrated into existing

   discussed in the literature, especially in the context of agile in the
   large, are analysed. The findings from the literature are validated by
   and compared to an industrial inventory. Based on the validation and the
   comparison, new approaches for agile adoption in large settings have
   been identified: incremental agile adoption approaches combining both
   bottom-up and top-down strategies; the important role of identified key
   practices that enable quick feedback and adaptation in the early
   adoption stages; and approaches derived from the multidimensional nature
   of agility. These approaches make possible to overcome the restrictions

Abstract = {The successful roll-out of the control software for a complex NIR
   imager/spectrograph with MOS calls for flexible development strategies

   waterfall strategy used in the beginning has to change to a more
   iterative and agile process in the later stages. The choice of an
   appropriate program language as well as suitable software layout is
   crucial. For example the software has to accomplish multiple demands of
   different user groups, including a high level of flexibility for later
   changes and extensions. Different access levels to the instrument are
   mandatory to afford direct control mechanisms for lab operations and
   inspections of the instrument as well as tools to accomplish efficient
   science observations. Our hierarchical software structure with four
   layers of increasing abstract levels and the use of an object oriented
   language ideally supports these requirements. Here we describe our
   software architecture, the software development process, the different
   access levels and our commissioning experiences with LUCIFER 1.},

Abstract = {Recently, there has been a noticeable increase of attention to
   regulatory compliance. As a result, more and more organizations are
   required to comply with the laws and regulations that apply to their
   industry sector. An important aspect of these regulations is directly
   related to the way by which software systems, used by regulated
   companies, are built, tested, and maintained. While some of these
   regulations require from these systems to support a very specific set of
   requirements, others, the focus of this paper, are concerned with the
   process by which the system has been built. The Food and Drug
   Administration (FDA) regulations, for example, impose stringent
   requirements on the process by which software systems used in medical
   devices are developed. One particular focus of the FDA regulations is on
   having a user-centered approach for building software for medical
   devices through the use of well-known concepts in the area of human
   factor engineering. In this paper, we discuss these requirements in
   detail and show how Extreme Programming, an agile process, lacks the

Abstract = {Agile software development methods are widely accepted and valued in
   software-dominated industries. In more complex setups like
   multidisciplinary system development the adoption of an agile
   development paradigm is much less straightforward. Bigger teams, longer
   development cycles, process and product standard compliance and products
   lacking flexibility make an agile behaviour more difficult to achieve.
   Focusing on the fundamental underlying problem of dealing with ever
   ongoing change, this paper presents an agile Systems Engineering
   approach as a potential solution. Therefore a generic Systems
   Engineering action model was upgraded respecting agile principles and
   adapted according to practical needs discovered in an empirical study.
   This study was conducted among the partners of the S2QI agile workgroup
   made up from experts of automotive, logistics and electronics
   industries. Additionally to an agile Systems Engineering action model, a
   list of 15 practical success factors that should be considered when
   using an agile Systems Engineering approach is one of the main outcomes
   of this survey. It was also found that an agile behaviour in Systems
   Engineering could be supported in many different areas within companies.
   These areas are listed and it is also shown how the agile action model
   and the agile success factors are related to them.},

   intermodulation product (IIP3). A better insertion loss in passbands is
   observed for a lower room temperature. Measured insertion loss of our
   fabricated diplexer is obtained between 5.3 to 2.89 dB and 5.2 to 3.7 dB
   over the tuning frequency range for the Tx and Rx channels filters
   bands, respectively. Both filters exhibit better than 40 dB rejection in
   the passband of its counterpart. The varactors diodes attached to both

Abstract = {As agile software development principles and methods are being adopted
   by large software product organizations it is important to understand
   the role of software entropy. That is, how the maintainability of a
   system may degrade over time due to continuous change. This may on one
   side affect the ability to act agile in planning and development. On the
   other side, an agile process may affect growth of entropy. We report
   from a case study of a successful software product line organization
   that has adopted the agile development method Evo, showing how agility
   and entropy are negatively related. We conclude this study by suggesting
   a two-step approach to manage entropy while maintaining process agility.
   First, the system needs to be restructured to establish a level of
   manageable entropy, and then, that the agile process must be
   complemented with continuous semi-automated quality monitoring and
   refactoring support.},

Abstract = {Decision Trees, algorithms, software code, risk management, reports,
   plans, drawings, change control, presentations, and analysis-all useful
   tools and efforts but time consuming, resource intensive, and
   potentially costly for projects that have absolute schedule and budget
   constraints.
   What are necessary and prudent efforts when a customer calls with a
   major security problem that needs to be fixed with a proven,
   off-the-approval-list, multi-layered integrated system with high
   visibility and limited funding and expires at the end of the Fiscal
   Year? Whether driven by budget cycles, safety, or by management decree,
   many such projects begin with generic scopes and funding allocated based
   on a rapid management ``guestimate.{''} Then a Project Manager (PM) is
   assigned a project with a predefined and potentially limited scope,
   compressed schedule, and potentially insufficient funding. The PM is
   tasked to rapidly and cost effectively coordinate a requirements-based
   design, implementation, test, and turnover of a fully operational system
   to the customer, all while the customer is operating and maintaining an
   existing security system. Many project management manuals call this an
   impossible project that should not be attempted. However, security is
   serious business and the reality is that rapid deployment of proven
   systems via an ``Extreme Project{''} is sometimes necessary. Extreme
   Projects can be wildly successful but require a dedicated team of
   security professionals lead by an experienced project manager using a
   highly-tailored and agile project management process with management
   support at all levels, all combined with significant interface with the
   customer.
   This paper does not advocate such projects or condone eliminating the
   valuable analysis and project management techniques. Indeed, having
   worked on a well-planned project provides the basis for experienced team
   members to complete Extreme Projects. This paper does, however, provide
   insight into what it takes for projects to be successfully implemented
   and accepted when completed under extreme conditions.},

Abstract = {We introduce a new tool - AESOPUS: Accurate Equation of State and
   OPacity Utility Software - for computing the equation of state and the
   Rosseland mean (RM) opacities of matter in the ideal gas phase. Results
   are given as a function of one pair of state variables, (i.e.
   temperature T in the range 3.2 <= log(T) <= 4.5, and parameter R =
   rho/(T/10(6) K)(3) in the range -8 <= log(R) <= 1), and arbitrary
   chemical mixture. The chemistry is presently solved for about 800
   species, consisting of almost 300 atomic and 500 molecular species. The
   gas opacities account for many continuum and discrete sources, including
   atomic opacities, molecular absorption bands, and collision-induced
   absorption. Several tests made on AESOPUS have proved that the new
   opacity tool is accurate in the results, flexible in the management of
   the input prescriptions, and agile in terms of computational time
   requirement. Purpose of this work is to greatly expand the public
   availability of Rosseland mean opacity data in the low-temperature
   regime. We set up a web-interface (http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/aesopus)
   which enables the user to compute and shortly retrieve RM opacity tables
   according to his/her specific needs, allowing a full degree of freedom
   in specifying the chemical composition of the gas. As discussed in the
   paper, useful applications may regard, for instance, RM opacities of gas
   mixtures with i) scaled-solar abundances of metals, choosing among
   various solar mixture compilations available in the literature; ii)
   varying CNO abundances, suitable for evolutionary models of red and
   asymptotic giant branch stars and massive stars in the Wolf-Rayet
   stages; iii) various degrees of enhancement in alpha-elements, and C-N,
   O-Na, and Mg-Al abundance anti-correlations, necessary to properly
   describe the properties of stars in early-type galaxies and Galactic
   globular clusters; iv) zero-metal abundances appropriate for studies of
   gas opacity in primordial conditions.},

   samples from 11 populations and identified 78 haplotypes. The
   phylogenetic analyses and analysis of molecular variance all supported
   the same conclusions of two well-differentiated east-west phylogroups,
   separated by the Tsangpo Great Gorge. The split between the two clades
   accounted for 58\% of the genetic variance observed among the examined
   samples. Waterfalls as effective barriers played an important role in
   shaping the phylogeographical structure of this species. Analyses of
   migration rates revealed that upstream dispersal was limited crossing
   waterfalls. Our study revealed substantial spatial and temporal
   variation in the influence of landscape features on contemporary
   patterns of genetic structure in S. o'connori. Interglacial range
   expansions clearly left their mark on contemporary populations above the

Abstract = {Agile software development (ASD) is an emerging approach in software
   engineering, initially advocated by a group of 17 software professionals
   who practice a set of ``lightweight{''} methods, and share a common set
   of values of software development. In this paper, we advance the
   state-of-the-art of the research in this area by conducting a
   survey-based ex-post-facto study for identifying factors from the
   perspective of the ASD practitioners that will influence the success of
   projects that adopt ASD practices. In this paper, we describe a
   hypothetical success factors framework we developed to address our
   research question, the hypotheses we conjectured, the research
   methodology, the data analysis techniques we used to validate the
   hypotheses, and the results we obtained from data analysis. The study
   was conducted using an unprecedentedly large-scale survey-based
   methodology, consisting of respondents who practice ASD and who had
   experience practicing plan-driven software development in the past. The
   study indicates that nine of the 14 hypothesized factors have
   statistically significant relationship with ``Success{''}. The important
   success factors that were found are: customer satisfaction, customer

Abstract = {Despite the popularity of agile methods in software development and
   increasing adoption by organizations there is debate about what agility
   is and how it is achieved. The debate suffers from a lack of
   understanding of agile concepts and how agile software development is
   practiced. This paper develops a framework for the organization of agile
   software development that identifies enablers and inhibitors of agility
   and the emergent capabilities of agile teams. The work is grounded in
   complex adaptive systems (CAS) and draws on three principles of
   coevolving systems: match coevolutionary change rate, maximize
   self-organizing, and synchronize exploitation and exploration. These
   principles are used to study the processes of two software development
   teams, one a team using eXtreme Programming (XP) and the other a team
   using a more traditional, waterfall-based development cycle. From the
   cases a framework for the organization of agile software development is
   developed. Time pacing, self-management with discipline and
   routinization of exploration are among the agile enablers found in the
   cases studies while event pacing, centralized management, and lack of
   resources allocated to exploration are found to be inhibitors to
   agility. Emergent capabilities of agile teams that are identified from
   the research include coevolution of business value, sustainable working
   with rhythm, sharing and team learning, and collective mindfulness.},

Title = {Weighing the Benefits and Costs of Flexibility in Making Software:
   Toward a Contingency Theory of the Determinants of Development Process
   Design},
Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In recent years, flexibility has emerged as a divisive issue in
   discussions about the appropriate design of processes for making
   software. Partisans in both research and practice argue for and against
   plan-based (allegedly inflexible) and agile (allegedly too flexible)
   approaches. The stakes in this debate are high; questions raised about
   plan-based approaches undermine longstanding claims that those
   approaches, when realized, represent maturity of practice. In this
   commentary, we call for research programs that will move beyond partisan
   disagreement to a more nuanced discussion, one that takes into account
   both benefits and costs of flexibility. Key to such programs will be the
   development of a robust contingency framework for deciding when (in what
   conditions) plan-based and agile methods should be used. We develop a
   basic contingency framework in this paper, one that models the
   benefit/cost economics described in narratives about the transition from
   craft to industrial production of physical products. We use this
   framework to demonstrate the power of even a simple model to help us
   accomplish three objectives: (1) to refocus discussions about the
   appropriate design of software development processes, concentrating on
   when to use particular approaches and how they might be usefully
   combined; (2) to suggest and guide a trajectory of research that can
   support and enrich this discussion; and (3) to suggest a
   technology-based explanation for the emergence of agile development at
   this point in history. Although we are not the first to argue in favor
   of a contingency perspective, we show that there remain many
   opportunities for information systems (IS) research to have a major
   impact on practice in this area.},

Abstract = {Extreme programming (XP), arguably the most popular agile development
   methodology, is increasingly finding favor among software developers.
   Its adoption and acceptance require significant changes in work habits
   inculcated by traditional approaches that emphasize planning,
   prediction, and control. Given the growing interest in XP, it is
   surprising that there is a paucity of research articles that examine the
   factors that facilitate or hinder its adoption and eventual acceptance.
   This study aims to fill this void. Using a case study approach, we
   provide insights into individual, team, technological, task, and
   environmental factors that expedite or impede the organization-wide
   acceptance of XP. In particular, we study widely differing patterns of
   adherence to XP practices within an organization, and tease out the
   various issues and challenges posed by the adoption of XP. Based on our
   findings, we evolve factors and discuss their implications on the
   acceptance of XP practices. European Journal of Information Systems

Abstract = {Software development is a complex undertaking that continues to present
   software project teams with numerous challenges. Software project teams
   are adopting extreme programming (XP) practices in order to overcome the
   challenges of software development in an increasingly dynamic
   environment. The ability to coordinate software developers' efforts is
   critical in such conditions. Expertise coordination has been identified
   as an important emergent process through which software project teams
   manage non-routine challenges in software development. However, the
   extent to which XP enables software project teams to coordinate
   expertise is unknown. Drawing on the agile development and expertise
   coordination literatures, we examine the role of collective ownership
   and coding standards as processes and practices that govern coordination
   in software project teams. We examine the relationship between
   collective ownership, coding standards, expertise coordination, and
   software project technical quality in a field study of 56 software
   project teams comprising 509 software developers. We found that
   collective ownership and coding standards play a role in improving
   software project technical quality. We also found that collective
   ownership and coding standards moderated the relationship between
   expertise coordination and software project technical quality, with
   collective ownership attenuating the relationship and coding standards
   strengthening the relationship. Theoretical and practical implications
   of the findings are discussed. European Journal of Information Systems

Title = {Simulating mixed agile and plan-based requirements prioritization
   strategies: proof-of-concept and practical implications},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Pages = {317-331},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In this paper, we address the efficacy and pragmatics of mixing two
   primary strategies for requirements prioritization in order to
   incorporate the benefits of both plan-based (PB) and agile development
   methods while avoiding their drawbacks. As it is intractable to directly
   study the performance of strategies on real projects, we conducted a
   comprehensive empirically based simulation under a variety of conditions
   of requirements dynamism, project size, and duration. Simulation results
   suggest that a mixed strategy for requirements prioritization seems to
   work best in all but cost for typical levels of dynamism on average. Our
   findings also indicate that, as theorized, PB and agile strategies
   perform well within opposite extremes of dynamism. However, they do not
   outperform the mixed strategies even within their home grounds - that is
   large and complex systems with stable requirements for PB, and small and
   dynamic projects for agile methods. Given the unknown, unknowable, or
   variable nature of dynamism and the dramatic differences in
   effectiveness for agile and PB strategies under extreme development
   scenarios, a mixed strategy appears to yield the best results overall.
   We introduce two mixed strategies - simply adding cost - benefit (CB) to
   the agile approach, and a more sophisticated `hybrid' (HY) approach that
   modulates development iteration size to maximize the expected CB for
   each iteration. We propose a step-by-step method to implement this HY
   strategy. We provide a structured analysis of the benefits and
   assumptions of agile and PB requirements prioritization methods (e. g.,
   Pareto optimization), and outline a framework for analyzing and
   assessing the effectiveness of strategies including several new metrics.
   This research can furthermore serve as a framework for future validation
   of the proposed mixed strategies using actual software projects.

Abstract = {This paper introduces the idea of extending quality assurance efforts in

   principle of disembodiment of CAD software systems and incorporates
   elements of existing well-established methodologies such as
   participatory design, extreme programming, and spiral software
   development. Under this approach, ideas' generation, theories' selection
   or creation, methods' development, algorithms' design, and pilot
   prototype implementation are the intermediate tasks in the early stages
   of the process of development of CAD software. Theories, methods,
   algorithms, and pilot prototypes are the deliverables of these tasks.
   Each task involves stepwise translation of requirements into a
   respective deliverable. Application experiences have shown that this
   procedure enlarges the scope of requirements' acquisition and quality
   assurance of CAD software. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.3130778]},

Abstract = {For many organizations the transition to agile methods is problematic
   due to history of bureaucratization and subsequent extensive

   self-organization and role interchangeability which are key elements of
   agile development. Knowing that bureaucracies are hard to counteract
   once established, how can development of general knowledge in software
   organizations be improved? Job rotation is a well-known practice often
   used to improve general knowledge. The reported action research
   evaluated job rotation among developers in customer support. The
   findings suggest that general knowledge is considered interesting and
   valuable among the participants. However, the findings also show that
   general knowledge acquisition can be found irrelevant and therefore
   counter-efficient for day-to-day work among participants if the
   perceived applicability to own projects is too low. Therefore, using job
   rotation to improve general knowledge requires careful considerations.
   Implications for research and practice are discussed.},

Abstract = {The Support 2.0 Team at our IT organization has recently completed Phase
   1 of the Support 2.0 project. Phase 1 was a four month endeavor with a
   primary focus of collecting data to understand why support was so costly

   believed that this initial phase would be critical to making significant
   impacts to the quality and supportability of applications.
   This experience report describes the challenge for the Support 2.0 Team
   and shares the successful adoption of agile practices in redefining the
   support organization. In the spirit of the agile transition to software
   development one year prior, our IT organization decided to rethink the
   approach to application support. By embracing agile principles and
   utilizing agile concepts, such as a cross-functional team, a team
   collaboration approach with frequent reviews to inspect and adapt as
   needed, etc, the business was able to reap immediate benefits.
   It was a challenging journey for the team, where the mix of
   onshore/offshore support engineers and an integrated client / vendor
   relationship within an agile team and focused framework helped to
   transform the support organization from an operational cost center to a
   value added thought partner. This resulted in a significantly improved
   culture and effectiveness of the support organization. This unique
   organization of an agile, cross-functional and team-based approach to

Abstract = {Yahoo! is a great proving ground for Agile. Since the introduction of
   Agile methods and practices into the company over five years ago, many
   contests of the Agile process have played out across the expansive
   Yahoo! software development landscape. Throughout its history, the
   spirit of Agile has survived, often in surprising and unexpected ways.
   Whether being mandated from the executive-level or arising from
   self-motivated small teams, one theme is constant - Agile has embedded
   itself into the DNA of Yahoo!. And to the present day, Agile continues
   to emerge and re-emerge in many forms from the dedicated individuals who
   use the tools of Agile to create some of the most innovative user
   experiences on the Internet.
   This paper offers an informal retrospective of the relative successes
   and failures of entetprise Agile adoption at Yahoo! from the period 2004
   to 2009.},

Abstract = {By late 2004, Scrum had been chosen independently as a development
   process by several teams at Amazon.com. From then until 2009, Scrum
   spread to a large portion of the software development teams at Amazon.
   This widespread adoption occurred in part due to the actions of a single
   individual and in part due to the natural match between Scrum's
   characteristics and the culture prevalent at Amazon.com. Widespread use
   of small, independent teams and a general empowerment at the team level
   made Scrum a smaller step to take for development teams at Amazon than
   it would be at many companies of equal or greater size. The success of
   Scrum at Amazon shows how important the prevailing culture of the
   company can be in terms of supporting an Agile transformation. These
   lessons are relevant to Scrum transformations being undertaken at many
   companies today.},

Abstract = {In 2008, our organization successfully implemented an agile software
   development approach (Scrum) across the Application Development
   department after piloting Scrum in 2007 with a few projects. In just
   four months, our department consisting of over 200 contractors and 70
   full time employees transitioned from a traditional waterfall-style
   approach (RUP) to Scrum. Less then 2 months later, we were running 40
   development projects that were time boxed to three months. In the
   previous year, we had 20 active projects with duration of 9 to 18
   months.
   After a year of introducing Agile, members of our organization were well
   aware of what Scrum was, but growing weary of training. There was a
   clear need to create excitement around the adoption and scaling of Scrum
   within the application development group. This led us to develop what we
   called `The Amazing Team Race.' This experience report is about how an
   agile transition team used a team-based approach for creating excitement
   while scaling Scrum in a globally distributed organization.},

   systematically develop a strategy for a second doubling in productivity.
   Two teams have achieved a sustainable quadrupling of productivity

Abstract = {Adopting agile methods requires an understanding of both the mechanics
   and the dynamics of value creation in software organizations. From a
   mechanics perspective, successful agile adoption is about ensuring that

   abstraction, that there is effective project management, and an
   environment exists that supports individual and group learning. The
   dynamics of value creation require an understanding of

   development of an organizational learning system, and last but not
   least, an effective governance strategy. This paper uses the lessons
   learned a case study of GameDevCo to illustrate these organizational

Abstract = {Defect management practices are considered an important part of
   traditional software development. While embracing agile methods,
   software development organizations have realized that defects still do
   exist and they must be managed. Therefore defect management practices
   should be migrated as well, but current instructions for such a change
   are fragmented or incomplete. We studied three software development
   organizations to find out what are the main problems to consider in
   defect management when migrating from waterfall to agile. We identified
   five issues related to process, tools and metrics in a multi-site
   organization. This paper proposes action items to deal with these issues
   during the agile migration planning activities.},

   addresses key concerns and characteristics of teamwork, and presents
   them along five dimensions that must be addressed when improving

   leadership, team orientation, redundancy, learning and autonomy. The
   instrument gives a radar plot of the status of the teamwork. We present

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the communication concerns that unfolded in a
   company as it endeavored to move from its existing waterfall model to an
   agile environment. A task team was established to adopt an agile
   practice and to trial it on a customer specific project. The team was
   given the freedom to be innovative and adopt whatever agile practices
   they wished. Early enthusiasm was evident however management had
   concerns about viability of this new approach. Management did not see
   the project plans and corresponding documentation trail of the waterfall
   model, and from their perspective it lacked structure. Trust between
   management and engineers weakened primarily due to a lack of
   communication and a reduction in the ability to work together, resulting
   in the waterfall model being reinstated.},

   Because of their relevance, the quality of automated acceptance tests is
   assured through software inspections. As a proof of concept, we
   conducted a first migration project of a web application towards both a
   web application framework and a mobile platform.},

   In addition to a successful knowledge transfer, results from this newly

   form of extended unit tests, as, well as lightweight prototypes. After
   one and half years we conducted a retrospective full-day workshop with
   our off-site usability engineer to reflect on the adopted process
   regarding the HCI instruments. This paper presents those reflections -

Abstract = {Agile methods are increasingly adopted by European companies. Academics
   too are conducting numerous studies on different tenets of agile
   methods. Companies often feel proud in marketing themselves as `agile'.
   However, the true notion of `being agile' seems to have been overlooked
   due to lack of positioning of oneself for agility. This raises a call
   for more research and interactions between academia and the industry.
   The proposed workshop refers to this call. It will be highly relevant to
   participants, interested in positioning their company's agility from
   organizational, group or project perspectives. The positioning of
   agility will help companies to better align their agile practices with
   stakeholder values. Results of the workshop will be shared across
   participants and they will also have opportunity to continue their work
   on agile positioning in their companies. At broader level, the work done
   in this workshop will contribute towards developing Agile Positioning

   a journey as a metaphor for planning a software project. In the context
   of software project management the simulator can be used to compare
   traditional rather plan-driven project management methods with more
   agile approaches. Instead of pre-planning everything in advance agile
   approaches spread planning activities throughout the project and provide
   mechanisms for effectively dealing with uncertainty. The biggest

Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe a case study of the
   development, features and evaluation of a rich internet application for
   libraries. It aims to demonstrate best practice in the use of software
   standards, development processes and evaluation.
   Design/methodology/approach - Web 2.0, open source design methods and
   usability testing were used within an agile framework.
   Findings - The adoption of agile software development methods, coupled
   with usability testing, would enable the library community to take full
   advantage of the techniques and principles inherent in Web 2.0 open
   source software.
   Research limitations/implications - A major component of the evaluation
   of QJAX was a series of usability tests. As is the nature of most
   usability studies, the results are not generalisable.
   Originality/value - Aspects of agile software development methods, such
   as usability testing and iterative design, are recognised in the
   literature as contributing to the usability of library software.
   However, exploration of the use of a full agile framework plus usability
   testing to facilitate Web 2.0 open source software is rare in
   library-related literature.},

Abstract = {Agile software development methods are quite popular nowadays and are
   being adopted at an increasing rate in the industry every year. However,
   these methods are still lacking usability awareness in their development
   lifecycle, and the integration of usability/User-Centered Design (UCD)
   into agile methods is not adequately addressed. This paper presents the
   preliminary results of a recently conducted online survey regarding the
   current state of the integration of agile methods and usability/UCD. A
   world wide response of 92 practitioners was received. The results show
   that the majority of practitioners perceive that the integration of
   agile methods with usability/UCD has added value to their adopted
   processes and to their teams; has resulted in the improvement of
   usability and quality of the product developed; and has increased the
   satisfaction of the end-users of the product developed. The top most
   used HCI techniques are low-fidelity prototyping, conceptual designs,
   observational studies of users, usability expert evaluations, field
   studies, personas, rapid iterative testing, and laboratory usability
   testing.},

Abstract = {In recent years, agile methods have become more popular in the software
   industry. Agile methods are a new approach compared to plan-driven
   approaches. One of the most important shifts in adopting an agile
   approach is the central focus given to people in the process. This is
   exemplified by the independence afforded to developers in the
   development work they do. This work investigates the opinions of
   practitioners about daily stand-up meetings in the agile methods and the
   role of developer in that. For our investigation we joined a yahoo group
   called ``Extreme Programming{''}. Our investigation suggests that

Abstract = {Not only products but also product development get more and more
   complex. International teams at different locations spread over the
   globe have to elaborate adequate solutions in shorter project cycles.
   Market conditions are rapidly changing not only caused by increasing
   demands on individuality but also due to political, economic and
   ecological influences. In order to remain competitive, customer
   satisfaction is the key. A major hindrance in this context is the
   limited ability of customers to express or even comprehensively identify
   their own requirements. But also manufacturers often have a lack of
   knowledge concerning their customers or relevant target groups. The
   approach delineated in this contribution introduces a concept of
   adopting agile methods of the software community to engineering, which
   allows detecting aberrations from demands and requirements early in the
   development process. The aim is to iteratively build (virtual)
   prototypes that consider only the main and obvious requirements in the
   first step. After each iteration an evaluation discloses whether the
   realization has met the expectations or not and additional requirements
   can be taken into account for the next step. This minimizes the overall
   risk of developing unsatisfactory products.},

Abstract = {These days the outcome of projects can easily impact the financial
   well-being of a company. Specifically software projects, due to their
   nature of being adaptable throughout the development process, have been
   a lot under investigation. Different aspects have been examined and
   revealed why projects can fail. The CHOAS report published in 2004
   states that only 34 percent of investigated software project have
   succeeded Most of the reasons that were stated by this report refer to
   process issues. Often human issues are really the root cause of process
   issues. Gerald Weinberg, a well known US software development consultant
   who has started to study software engineering as human behavior in 1971,
   is known for saying that ``no matter what they tell You, it's always a
   people problem{''}. Usually people issues lead to emotions in teams.
   Cerny explains that emotions of project team members always play a key
   role in project success. Emotions of project teams are inevitable
   because of the high dynamic nature of projects. ``Individuals and teams
   in projects need emotional competencies (as part of social competencies)
   to handle emotions.{''}
   How people handle emotions is often influenced by human factors of the
   organizational environment.
   This paper/presentation provides an overview about what human factors
   and emotions of teams mean to project success. It further introduces a
   number of practices applied in Agile development methodologies that can
   help to increase communication, interaction, and collaboration within
   software project teams. A lot of these practices have shown some real
   impacts on productivity and quality as they focus more on people and
   less on complicated use of tools.},

Abstract = {The global market is evermore volatile and turbulent; it requires rapid
   responses to the emerging customers needs, also to unpredictable ones.
   Companies are forced towards a continuous research and innovation in
   terms of flexible technologies and processes in order to provide a high
   level of market adaptability. In this context, agile approaches,
   intended as a set of strategies to face the market variability, have to
   be investigated. They have to interest all processes related to the
   product development phase. This paper is focused on how to implement an
   efficient agile strategy in product design. The proposed approach is
   based on product modularity and on the integration of computer-aided
   design (CAD)-based tools to support feasibility analysis on virtual
   prototypes. It allows the concurrent management of possible changes in
   both product and process platforms by adopting virtual prototypes for
   performing simulations. The implemented platforms and the connected
   virtual prototype are structured according to modularity principles. The
   virtual prototype is defined as a collection of geometrical, functional,
   structural, manufacturing, environmental information, contained in the
   modules of the product and process platforms. An industrial example,
   belonging to the wellness production field (such as bathtubs and shower
   stalls), is described to validate the agile approach. It has been
   applied to solve a particularly meaningful problem: how to improve the
   bathtubs production process by reducing manufacturing and assembly costs
   while improving product customisability, eco-sustainability and quality.
   Once analysed, the context and the design constraints, in terms of cost,
   of environmental performance and, mainly, of aesthetic product features
   customisation, a new manufacturing process has been introduced based on
   the injection moulding technology instead of traditional thermoforming
   sheets.},

Abstract = {The influence of density differences on the mixing of the primary loop
   inventory and the emergency core cooling (ECC) water in the cold leg and
   downcomer of a pressurized water reactor (PWR) was analyzed at the
   Rossendorf coolant mixing (ROCOM) test facility. This paper presents a
   matrix of ROCOM experiments in which water with the same or higher
   density, was injected into a cold leg of the reactor model with already
   established natural circulation conditions at different low mass flow
   rates. Wire-mesh sensors measuring the concentration of a tracer in the
   injected water were installed in the cold leg, upper and lower part of
   the downcomer A transition matrix from momentum to buoyancy-driven flow
   experiments was selected for validation of the computational fluid
   dynamics software ANSYS CFX. A hybrid mesh with 4 X 106 elements was
   used for the calculations. The turbulence models usually applied in such
   cases assume that turbulence is isotropic, whilst buoyancy actually
   induces anisotropy Thus, in this paper, higher order turbulence models
   have been developed and implemented, which take into account that
   anisotropy. Buoyancy generated source and dissipation terms were
   proposed and introduced into the balance equations for the turbulent
   kinetic energy. The results of the experiments and of the numerical
   calculations show that mixing strongly depends on buoyancy effects: At
   higher mass flow rates (close to nominal conditions) the injected slug
   propagates in the circumferential direction around the core barrel.
   Buoyancy effects reduce this circumferential propagation with lower mass
   flow rates and/or higher density differences. The ECC waterfalls in an
   almost vertical path and reaches the lower downcomer sensor directly
   below the inlet nozzle. Therefore, density effects play an important
   role during natural convection with the ECC injection in PWR and should
   be also considered in pressurized thermal shock scenarios. ANSYS CFX was
   able to predict the observed flow patterns and mixing phenomena quite
   well. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.2983137]},

Abstract = {Test-Driven Development (TDD) is an agile development process wherein
   automated tests are created before production code is designed or
   constructed in short, rapid iterations. This paper discusses an
   experiment conducted with undergraduate students in a year-long software
   engineering capstone course. In this course the students designed,
   implemented, deployed, and maintained a software system to meet the
   requirements of an industry sponsor who served as the customer. The
   course followed an incremental process in which features were added
   incrementally under the direction of the industry sponsor and the
   professor. The fourteen students observed in the study were divided into
   three teams. Among the three teams were two experimental groups. One
   group consisted of two teams that applied a Test-First (TDD)
   methodology, while a control group applied a traditional Test-Last
   methodology. Unlike Test-First, the tests in Test-Last are written after
   the design and construction of the production code being tested Results
   from this experiment differ from many previous studies. In particular,
   the Test-Last team was actually more productive and wrote more tests
   than their Test-First counterparts. Anecdotal evidence suggests that
   factors other than development approach such as individual ambition and
   team motivation may have more affect than the development approach
   applied. Although more students indicated a preference for the
   Test-First approach, concerns regarding learning and applying TDD with
   unfamiliar technologies are noted.},

Abstract = {Contemporary Information System Development (ISD) is performed within
   operational environments characterized by rapid change across many
   dimensions - including personnel, user requirements, regulation, and
   technology architectures. The rapidity, extent, and inevitability of
   this environmental change are credited as the major catalysts for a move
   away from traditional, plan-driven ISD methods (i.e. the Waterfall
   method) toward the agile method paradigm. Agile methods are known for
   several main operational strategies, including iterative development,
   significant user involvement and frequent releases. Agile method
   adoption, however, does come with risks. These risks must be carefully
   identified and managed within any potential agile-adopter. This is
   particularly so within a small adopting organization that is less able
   to absorb the impact of any significant level of failed ISD
   experimentation. This study describes the identification and analysis of
   the major risk in the adoption of agile methods by a
   Small-to-Medium-Enterprise (SME) software developer. The study was
   completed over a twelve month period during which the SME moved from
   Waterfall ISD to agile ISD. Research data has been obtained via an
   exploratory case study utilizing the risk-identifying Agility/Discipline
   Assessment (A/DA). The A/DA data collection involved interviews and
   observations across three different SME sources: project managers,
   project team members, and customers. The case study factor analysis
   synthesised the experiences of these stake holders to produce a
   comprehensive understanding of the strategic management challenges. The
   contribution from this study is that the SME agile method adoption faced
   one very major risk - a risk that could not be effectively controlled.
   The risk is posed by the need for the SME and the customer to formalize
   the customer relationship via the negotiation of an appropriate
   contract. It proves very difficult to negotiate such a contract whilst
   not constraining the full potential of agile ISD.},

   the problem domain, the system constructed, the software designers, and
   the ``customers{''} ultimately deriving value from the system. Agile
   practices no longer have the luxury of ``choosing{''} small non-mission
   critical projects with co-located teams. Project stakeholders are
   selecting and adapting practices based on a combination of interest,
   need and staffing. For example, growing product portfolios through a
   merger or the acquisition of a company exposes legacy systems to new
   staff, new software integration challenges, and new ideas. Innovation in
   communications (tools and processes) to span the growth and contraction
   of both information and organizations, while managing the adoption of
   changing software practices, is imperative for success. Traditional
   web-based tools such as web pages, document libraries, and forums are
   not sufficient. A blend of tweeting, blogs, wikis, instant messaging,
   web-based conferencing, and telepresence creates a new dimension of
   communication ``best{''} practices.},

Abstract = {Structured System Analysis and Design (SSAD) is still considered one of
   the most straightforward systems approaches, despite both supporting
   arguments and criticisms. One philosophy in software engineering is to
   ``document everything{''}. However, the waterfall model within SSAD
   discourages frequent changing of requirements, which is a significant
   problem to designers. Compared with SSAD, Component-Based Software
   Engineering (CBSE) with its modular structured solution allows
   individual components to be replaced easily at design time or run time
   if the requirements of the initial component (expressed via the
   interface) are met by the replacement component.
   After years of experience in developing and architecting reliable
   architectures for software-intensive distributed systems, the authors
   present a PAISE (Perspective-bridged Architecture with Interoperability,
   Substitutability, and Extensibility) model with the aim of automating
   systems perspective transitioning through a document-driven approach
   within SSAD. The authors stress important abilities of architecting
   application systems such as interoperability, substitutability, and
   extensibility in support of component-based software engineering. PAISE
   starts with a conceptual system that is rapidly prototyped for
   requirements, follows with a technical system that addresses the
   interior structure of the system, and results in an operational system
   for business process.
   In combination with re-ADA (an architectural description language as
   well as its runtime foundation), PAISE/re-ADA can not only promote a
   document-driven approach with SSAD, but also automate system perspective
   transitioning with CBSE.},

Abstract = {The business world of today is highly competitive. Business users demand
   IT organizations to adapt quickly to changes and provide on-time,
   cost-effective solutions. This compels companies to took closely at
   their software development processes, to improve them and remain
   cost-effective. Offshoring is a well-known cost-effective solution for
   projects that follow waterfall and other traditional software
   development life cycles (SDLC). Waterfall SDLC may not be ideal when
   requirements are changing rapidly. Achieving rapidness in software
   development along with offshoring will enable companies to provide quick
   and cost effective IT solutions. To manage rapidly changing
   requirements, a large telecommunications company moved out of
   traditional waterfall model and adopted Extreme programming (XP)
   software development methodology. This paper discusses, in detail, a
   Telecommunication software project case study along with the customized
   XP onsite-offshore model that was successfully used in developing the
   project. This paper also share the lessons learnt from this XP
   onsite-offshore model.},

   However SPI strategies based on CMMI-DEV require heavy software

   software development processes, such as Agile Software Development
   (ASD), deal with these challenges. ASD welcomes changing requirements
   and stresses the importance of adaptive planning, simplicity and
   continuous delivery of valuable software by short time-framed
   iterations. ASD is becoming convenient in a more and more global, and
   changing software market. It would be greatly useful to be able to
   introduce agile methods such as Scrum in compliance with CMMI process

Abstract = {The data utilized on daily mass balance in oil refineries are generated
   from the records of products movements and flow and quality measurements
   existing in the refining processes. This data usually shows low quality
   and inconsistencies and it should be examined and treated. It was used a
   technique of data reconciliation to assess those inconsistencies and
   generate a set of data that allow reliable analysis, which support
   decisions about process. The data generated by data reconciliation are
   going to feed the accounting systems and support decisions of the
   operation and analysis teams. In order to improve data reconciliation
   system management data, it became more agile and practical, it is
   necessary to treat raw data that come from site and were recorded in the
   refinery information systems. The software developed has a function of
   capture raw data record in the system of registration and control of
   operations and link these data with measurements in the refining
   processes. This pooling of information brings a gain of quantity and
   quality to the data reconciliation system, reducing mathematical
   problems of non-solubility drive by configuration of refining processes
   and allocation of measurements. The software also evaluates the closing
   of balance sheet of each tank and carries a previous distribution of
   differences, which come from low precision of measurements. This
   functionality of system intended that data were as close to reality of
   the process as possible and also attend accounting requirements,
   increasingly rigid, imposed to oil refining companies. To achieve this
   goal, it was made modifications on a consecrated numerical technique, in
   order to adapt this to the problem and to the singular objective
   function that mathematically describes the problem. All these analyses
   are generated by software algorithms and occur automatically in hours
   previously scheduled. With the data processed in the case of
   mathematical problems and evaluated in order to attend mass balance
   constraints, reports are generated and will be used by analysis
   accounting team of refinery. This software is deployed in the largest
   Brazilian oil refinery and the data generated through it as used as the
   basis for the accounting closure of this site.},

Abstract = {One of the more important issues in the development of larger scale
   complex systems (product development period of two or more years) is
   accommodating changes to requirements. Requirements gathered for larger
   scale systems evolve during lengthy development periods due to changes
   in software and business environments, new user needs and technological
   advancements. Agile methods, which focus on accommodating change even
   late in the development lifecycle, can be adopted for the development of
   larger scale systems. However, as currently applied, these practices are
   not always suitable for the development of such systems. We propose a
   soft-structured framework combining the principles of agile and
   conventional software development that addresses the issue of rapidly
   changing requirements for larger scale systems. The framework consists
   of two parts: (1) a soft-structured requirements gathering approach that
   reflects the agile philosophy i.e., the Agile Requirements Generation
   Model and (2) a tailored development process that can be applied to
   either small or larger scale systems.},

Abstract = {The U. S. National Science Foundation supported Consortium of
   Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Sciences (CUAHSI)
   Hydrologic Information System (HIS) project includes extensive
   development of data storage and delivery tools and standards including
   WaterML (a language for sharing hydrologic data sets via web services),
   and HIS Server (a software tool set for delivering WaterML from a
   server). These and other CUASHI HIS tools have been under development
   and deployment for several years and together present a relatively
   complete software ``stack{''}, to support the consistent storage and
   delivery of hydrologic and other environmental observation data. This
   paper describes the development of a new HIS software tool called ``HIS
   Desktop{''} and the development of an online open source software
   development community to update and maintain the software.
   HIS Desktop was envisioned as a local (i.e. not server-based) client
   side software tool that ultimately will run on multiple operating
   systems and will provide a highly usable level of access to HIS
   Services. The software will provide several capabilities including data
   query, map-based visualization, data download, local data maintenance,
   editing, graphing, data export to selected model-specific data formats,
   linkage with integrated modeling systems such as OpenMI, and ultimately
   upload to the HIS server from the local desktop software. As the
   software is presently in the early stages of development, this paper
   focuses on design approach and paradigm and is presented to encourage
   participation in the open development community. Indeed, recognizing the
   value of community based code development as a means of ensuring
   end-user adoption, this project has adopted an ``iterative{''} or
   ``spiral{''} software development approach where 1) the general project
   requirements and hard boundary conditions are specified at the outset;
   2) an initial brief functionality requirements list is developed; 3) the
   initial limited system is produced primarily by the core funded
   developer team, but with voluntary external programmer support as it
   becomes available; 4) testing and bug fixes by the developer team; 5)
   deployment of an installation package for end-users; 6) collection of
   bug notices and feature requests from end-users; 7) identification of
   specific bugs and features to be addressed in a new release; 8) addition
   of these features by the developer team, etc.
   This development approach is the most common approach used by open
   source projects because of its flexible and dynamic nature. This model
   is well suited to a community project where it is difficult (and often
   not useful) to fully-specify the functionality set required for a
   software release (i.e. as in the ``waterfall{''} development approach),
   but rather it is desirable to maintain an open structure that can easily
   be extended through the development of third party plug-ins to support
   as-yet unknown functions and capabilities, as well as a clear policy on
   how code is moved into the core system, and how external developers are
   included in the developer team.},

   process management the simulator can be used to compare traditional
   rather plan-driven methods for planning and executing a business process
   with more agile approaches supporting different decision deferral
   patterns. Instead of pre-planning everything in advance decision
   deferral patterns allow interleaving process modeling and execution and
   provide mechanisms for effectively dealing with uncertainty The biggest
   challenge thereby is to find the right balance between pre-planning
   activities and keeping options open. The Alaska Simulator allows to
   explore how much planning is needed under different circumstances.},

Abstract = {Production systems will become increasingly complex to handle flexible
   business processes and systems. Engineering systems and tools from
   several sources have to cooperate for building agile component-based
   systems. While there are approaches for the technical integration of
   component-based industrial automation systems, there is only little work
   on the effective and efficient integration of engineering tools and
   systems along the automation systems lifecycle. In this paper we
   introduce the concept of the ``Automation Service Bus{''} (ASB) based on
   technical and semantic integration concepts for general software

Abstract = {This paper describes a methodology that providers of services can use to
   adapt their software applications, both intra-net and inter-net systems,
   to the changes of their business environment. The methodology enables
   agile software development based on a Web process architecture that
   executes ontology-based business processes as workflow systems. Ontology
   construction technology is used to extract business model of tasks and
   processes from business documents, model them, and organize them.
   Reflective semantics interoperates between RDF/XML representation of
   business tasks and Java objects of business process primitives. The gap
   between business models and service system applications is bridged by a
   Java-based software framework that executes business process as a set of
   Web page transitions. As a result, a business model is implemented as a
   thin client application. The software framework enables rapid spiral
   development of short-term cycles because business modelers, software
   developers, and users are able to share the same framework of
   description and systems. The feasibility of the methodology described
   here has been demonstrated in projects developing local-government
   workflow systems.},

Abstract = {The importance of good software testing is often reported.
   Traditionally, acceptance testing is the last stage of the testing
   process before release to the customer. Unfortunately, it is not always
   appropriate to wait so long for customer feedback. Emerging agile
   methods recognise this and promote close interaction between the
   customer and developers for early acceptance testing, often before
   implementation commences. Indeed, Acceptance Test Driven Development
   (ATDD) is a process that uses customer interaction to define tests and
   tool support to automate and execute these. However, with existing
   tools, tests are usually written from new descriptions or rewritten from
   existing documentation. Here, the challenge is to allow developers and
   customers to annotate existing documentation and automatically generate
   acceptance tests without rewrites or new descriptions. This paper
   introduces the related ideas and describes a particular experiment that
   assesses the value of using annotated text to create acceptance tests.},

Abstract = {The assumptions that underlie software development often go unrecorded
   and form part of the implicit rationale on which design and
   implementation decisions are based. These assumptions can fail at any

   approach to assumption management (AM) designed to suit agile
   development.
   Assumptions were monitored for three months within a small agile team.
   Two key indicators were proposed for measuring AM success but only one
   was detected in the research results. A number of strong correlations
   were found between properties Of assumptions. Data collection largely
   depended on the subjective judgements of the first author, but they were
   validated with some success by his colleagues.
   In some ways, assumption management was found to complement agile
   development. However, AM was not fully integrated into the team's
   development process, due to difficulty in adopting an `assumption-aware'
   way of thinking. Suggestions are offered on how this transition may be
   eased, and on how others might wish to build on this research.},

   governance roles, responsibilities and deliverables seemed to be in
   place on different organizational levels. However, closer inspection
   revealed challenges in the practical implementation. There were too many
   roles and hierarchy levels with information consistency problems in
   between. Prioritization of the high-level goals was unclear and made it
   difficult to plan and organize development work based on business value.
   The trace from high-level goals to more detailed plans was easily
   corrupted due to poor planning practices. Progress monitoring of daily
   work was poorly done and not linked to high-level plans. Consequently,
   the required feedback loops were inadequate, making it impossible for
   management to take corrective actions in time.},

Abstract = {A number of recent studies reported on the success of applying agile
   methods in scientific software development projects. These studies found
   that agile methods are well suited to the exploratory, iterative, and
   collaborative nature of scientific inquiry. However, these findings
   might not be applicable in all situations pertaining to scientific
   software development projects. In addition, they only constitute a
   subset of the important factors while deciding which development methods
   and practices should be adopted. Therefore, it becomes important to
   conduct further research before making recommendations regarding the
   adoption of certain development methods and practices in this domain. In
   this progress report, we discuss our on-going research that will
   empirically study the characteristics of various scientific software
   development projects according to a model suggested by Boehm and Turner.
   We plan to conduct interviews and collect data from various scientific
   software development projects in the Baltimore-Washington area. We
   expect that our qualitative results will increase our understanding of
   the characteristics in those projects favoring plan-driven approaches or
   agile methods, and the needs and conditions associated with those
   characteristics. Our research provides guidance to scientific software
   developers by enhancing their capacity to evaluate and understand their
   own project characteristics and select effective software practices. As
   a long-term benefit in the same direction, our qualitative results will
   generate a set of hypotheses that can be tested in different project
   environments to better understand and categorize scientific software
   development projects. Consequently, in the future, more generalizable
   and actionable recommendations can be made for scientific software

   examine some of those key techniques for possible application in the

   the key Agile publications and the germane DO-178B work. Virtually all
   Agile practices can be mapped to a DO-178B software development process.
   We provide a detailed analysis of the key practices, with a preliminary
   assessment of the ease of implementation for each. An analysis of a
   number of the difficulties involving transitioning from a traditional
   waterfall software development process to Agile practices will show
   that, though difficult, a transition is possible. The transition to
   Agile development does not require sudden, sweeping change, but instead
   can be accomplished through incorporating Agile methods into an existing
   process. We will document successful integration of test-driven
   development, pair programming, refactoring, an iterative approach, and
   other Agile methods into a traditional DO-178B software development
   process. We conclude with a call for a collaborative effort to further
   explore Agile as an answer to the urgent need for new approaches to
   complex systems that have become increasingly difficult to verify and

Abstract = {The business-critical chain lifecycle is an agile software development
   lifecycle that aims at aligning the software project deliverables to
   attain the business objectives based on business priorities. The
   traditional software development projects work on the assumption that
   all `equal effort consumers' would be treated equally and worked upon.
   The agile methodology ensures that the delivery cycles are reduced thus
   introducing agility in the way business is supported by underlying
   technologies. The proposed lifecycle model introduces new variables
   pertaining to the business value generation each finished piece of code
   would produce. Hence the software project processes have to be modified
   to cater to it.
   Even the usual agile lifecycle testing strategies need to be modified to
   suit the proposed model. The test plans, test estimations, test resource
   management, quality control, regression plans and automation road map
   and plans have to be customized to cater to the new life cycle model.
   The secondary project management activities such as risk management,
   procurement management, etc also may to be modified with respect to the
   testing processes.
   My paper aims at using the critical chain principles and proposes a
   software lifecycle model that can cater to business priorities and
   aligning the testing processes not only to development cycles but also
   to the actual business value created. In this paper I would take a case
   study and compare and contrast when project uses the regular models and
   this new model. I would also provide guidelines to use this lifecycle
   model and modify regular project management activities to cater to the
   new model with emphasis on the testing processes. The paper would try to
   provide the ideal scenarios; in project teams, in consulting firms and
   in new customers and expectations; where such a model could provide high
   impact on the way consulting companies can do successful projects and
   creating more value to the customers.},

Abstract = {Agile Software Development is regarded as an effective and efficient
   approach, mainly due to its ability to accommodate rapidly changing
   requirements, and cope with modern software development challenges.
   There is therefore a strong tendency to use agile software development
   methodologies where applicable; however, the sheer number of existing
   agile methodologies and variants hinders the selection of the
   appropriate agile methodology or method chunk. Evaluation tools address
   this problem through providing detailed evaluations of these
   methodologies, yet no appropriate evaluation framework is available to
   developers. We introduce the Comprehensive Evaluation Framework for
   Agile Methodologies (CEFAM) as an evaluation tool for project managers
   and method engineers. The hierarchical (and mostly quantitative)
   evaluation criterion set introduced in this evaluation framework
   enhances the usability of the framework and provides results that are
   precise enough to be useful for the selection of agile methodologies.},

Abstract = {In order to fulfill every project-specific requirement in software
   development today, and produce a soft-ware product with desired
   functionality and satisfactory quality, attributes, adequate development
   and management processes ought to be designed, implemented, adopted,
   operated and/or improved. Mandatory requests on shorter time to market,
   staying within the budget limit and producing high quality software
   become even more stressful for project stakeholders when dealing with
   complex software systems, like the ones for enterprise resource planning
   or multidimensional drafting of complex models for technical and
   engineering products. Based on the real-life experience, that is
   thoroughly analyzed here, in integrating such two complex software
   systems, a hybrid process model for project management and software
   development in agile environment is proposed in this paper. The model
   attributes specially stressed out and analyzed are suitability for agile
   conditions and adaptive behavior. Conclusion gives usage perspective for
   such a hybrid model, with limitations discussed and future work
   proposed.},

Abstract = {Agile development methods have gained momentum in the last few years
   and, as a consequence, test-driven development has become more prevalent
   in practice. However, test cases are not sufficient for producing
   dependable software and we rather advocate approaches that emphasize the
   use of assertions or contracts over that of test cases. Yet, writing
   self-checks in code has been shown to be difficult and is itself prone
   to errors. A standard technique to specify runtime properties is
   design-by-contract (DbC). But how can one test if the contracts
   themselves are sensible and sufficient? We propose a measure to quantify
   the goodness of contracts (or assertions in a broader sense). We
   introduce meta-mutations at the source code level to simulate common
   programmer errors that the self-checks are supposed to detect. We then
   use random mutation testing to determine a lower and upper bound on the
   detectable mutations and compare these bounds with the number of mutants
   detected by the contracts. Contracts are considered ``good{''} if they
   detect a certain percentage of the detectable mutations. We have
   evaluated our tools on Java classes with contracts specified using the
   Java Modeling Language (JML). We have additionally tested the contract
   quality of 19 implementations, written independently by students, based
   on the same specification.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an investigation of the failures associated with the
   introduction of a new software development methodology in a software
   project team. The failure to adopt the new methodology is seen as a
   failure to learn by the team. This paper posits that learning is more
   than the cognitive process of acquiring a new skill; learning also
   involves changes in behaviours, attitudes and opinions. As methodology
   adoption involves changes to a team's activities, values and norms, this
   study investigates the introduction of an Agile method by a software
   team as a learning experience. Researchers use the concepts of single-
   and double-loop learning to explain how social actors learn to (a)
   perforin tasks efficiently and (b) decide on the best task to perform.
   The theory of triple-loop learning explains how a learning process can
   be ineffective; accordingly, it is employed to examine why the
   introduction of a new methodology was ineffective in the team studied.
   The theory illustrates how power factors influence learning. This study
   focuses on one specific power factor - the power inherent in the desire
   for cohesion and conformity within a team. Ineffective decision-making
   and related actions occur because of the desire to conform among group
   members; this was shown as the cause of ineffective learning in the
   software team. The findings illustrate how the values inherent in the
   Agile methodologies, primarily the desire for cohesion within the team,
   ultimately led to the failure of the team to learn.},

Abstract = {The VENUS (http://venus.uvic.ca/) and NEPTUNE Canada
   (http://neptunecanada.ca/) cabled ocean observatories have been
   envisioned from their inception as underwater extensions of the
   Internet. Having sensors connected to a network opens up tremendous
   opportunities, from real-time access to sensor measurements to the
   interactive control of remote assets. Moreover, with a software system
   in control, data from all sensors can be managed, archived and made
   available to the wider community. Finally, a data management system can
   also offer features that are unique to centrally managed
   instrumentation: thanks to communication standards, autonomous event
   detection and reaction becomes a very powerful possibility.
   This talk will summarize the salient features of DMAS (Data Management
   and Archiving System) that have been implemented over the past four
   years as well as the planned features to be delivered soon.
   DMAS consists of two main components:
   The Data Acquisition Framework (DAF) takes care of the interaction with
   instruments in terms of control, monitoring as well as data acquisition
   and storage The framework also contains operation control tools.
   The user interaction features include data search and retrieval, data
   distribution. Current developments in the Web 2.0 area will provide a
   complete research environment where users will have the ability to work
   and interact on-line with colleagues, process and visualize data,
   establish observation schedules and pre-program autonomous, event
   detection and reaction. We call this environment ``Oceans 2.0{''}.
   The architecture of DMAS is focused on limiting the amount of data loss
   and maximizing up time. It is a service oriented architecture, making
   use of some of the more advanced tools available. The code is written in
   Java and makes use of an Enterprise Service Bus and of the
   publish-and-subscribe paradigm.
   The paper also describes the management approaches that were adopted to
   build DMAS. Good code quality, the continuous support of VENUS and the
   need for flexibility in dealing with rapidly changing requirements were
   the drivers behind the adoption of in-house development, the Agile
   development methodology and the creation of three teams. The development
   team deals with requirement collection, analysis, design, coding and
   unit testing; the QA/QC team performs software tests and regression in a
   production-like environment. The systems/operations team focuses on the
   hardware and system software preparation and support, receives and
   installs new code releases after QA approval and monitors systems
   operations. We are vying to perform new code releases twice a month. The
   method has worked well during the four years of the system development
   phase and has allowed for a constant support of VENUS. DMAS will be
   completed well under budget.},

Abstract = {A software development process is required not only to guide and
   structure the development activity but at the same time it should allow
   improvement in the process itself. Agile development methodologies are
   said to be flexible and adaptive to the context in which these are
   applied. This flexibility and adaptability, makes experimentation with
   the process more plausible and opens new ways to learn by experience.
   This paper is based on the theoretical analysis of an Extreme
   Programming (XP) process deployed to develop a multimedia streaming
   application for mobile phones. It presents the steps taken to initiate
   the development process, its setup and the continuous review of the
   process in order to find the best suited way to perform the practices
   which are needed for a software development activity, as well as,
   workable for the development team. The paper gives a detailed account of
   the implementation, analysis and the adjustment of the individual XP
   practices in order to emphasize how the development team has learned to
   shape the XP process according to the organization and the project
   context in which it is applied.},

Abstract = {Standard process models like RUP or the German V-Modell XT are developed
   to be used in an organizational environment. Yet introducing such a
   process model into an organization is no simple task. It is usually
   accompanied by either reorganizing internal processes to comply with a
   standard process model or by adaptation of the process model to
   organizational structures. The latter is an approach that can often be
   found in practice and is subject to this paper.
   The paper describes a generalization of the process model architecture
   of the V-Modell XT 1.3. Compared to the previous version 1.2.1.1, its
   metamodel has completely been revised with respect to a new adaptation
   concept. We will see how this concept allows the implementation of a so
   called process line. Software process lines are derived from software
   product lines and can be used for the adaptation of standard processes
   during process model development, project initialization and project
   runtime.},

Abstract = {Cardiac modelling is the area of physiome modelling where the available
   simulation software is perhaps most mature, and it therefore provides an
   excellent starting point for considering the software requirements for
   the wider physiome community. In this paper, we will begin by
   introducing some of the most advanced existing software packages for
   simulating cardiac electrical activity. We consider the software
   development methods used in producing codes of this type, and discuss
   their use of numerical algorithms, relative computational efficiency,
   usability, robustness and extensibility.
   We then go on to describe a class of software development methodologies
   known as test-driven agile methods and argue that such methods are more
   suitable for scientific software development than the traditional
   academic approaches. A case study is a project of our own, Cancer, Heart
   and Soft Tissue Environment, which is a library of computational biology
   software that began as an experiment in the use of agile programming
   methods. We present our experiences with a review of our progress thus
   far, focusing on the advantages and disadvantages of this new approach
   compared with the development methods used in some existing packages.
   We conclude by considering whether the likely wider needs of the cardiac
   modelling community are currently being met and suggest that, in order
   to respond effectively to changing requirements, it is essential that
   these codes should be more malleable. Such codes will allow for reliable
   extensions to include both detailed mathematical models of the heart and
   other organs and more efficient numerical techniques that are currently
   being developed by many research groups worldwide.},

Abstract = {Agile software development represents a major departure from
   traditional, plan-based approaches to software engineering. A systematic
   review of empirical studies of agile software development up to and
   including 2005 was conducted. The search strategy identified 1996
   studies, of which 36 were identified as empirical studies. The studies
   were grouped into four themes: introduction and adoption, human and
   social factors, perceptions on agile methods, and comparative studies.
   The review investigates what is currently known about the benefits and
   limitations of, and the strength of evidence for, agile methods.
   Implications for research and practice are presented. The main
   implication for research is a need for more and better empirical studies
   of agile software development within a common research agenda. For the
   industrial readership, the review provides a map of findings, according
   to topic, that can be compared for relevance to their own settings and
   situations. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development practice that
   has been used sporadically for decades. With this practice, a software
   engineer cycles minute-by-minute between writing failing unit tests and
   writing implementation code to pass those tests. Test-driven development
   has recently re-emerged as a critical enabling practice of agile
   software development methodologies. However, little empirical evidence
   supports or refutes the utility of this practice in an industrial
   context. Case studies were conducted with three development teams at
   Microsoft and one at IBM that have adopted TDD. The results of the case
   studies indicate that the pre-release defect density of the four
   products decreased between 40\% and 90\% relative to similar projects
   that did not use the TDD practice. Subjectively, the teams experienced a
   15-35\% increase in initial development time after adopting TDD.},

Volume = {13},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Agile software development practices such as eXtreme Programming (XP)
   and SCRUM have increasingly been adopted to respond to the challenges of
   volatile business environments, where the markets and technologies
   evolve rapidly and present the unexpected. In spite of the encouraging
   results so far, little is known about how agile practices affect
   communication. This article presents the results from a study which
   examined the impact of XP and SCRUM practices on communication within
   software development teams and within the focal organization. The
   research was carried out as a case study in F-Secure where two agile
   software development projects were compared from the communication
   perspective. The goal of the study is to increase the understanding of
   communication in the context of agile software development: internally
   among the developers and project leaders and in the interface between
   the development team and stakeholders (i.e. customers, testers, other
   development teams). The study shows that agile practices improve both
   informal and formal communication. However, it further indicates that,
   in larger development situations involving multiple external
   stakeholders, a mismatch of adequate communication mechanisms can
   sometimes even hinder the communication. The study highlights the fact
   that hurdles and improvements in the communication process can both
   affect the feature requirements and task subtask dependencies as
   described in coordination theory. While the use of SCRUM and some XP
   practices facilitate team and organizational communication of the
   dependencies between product features and working tasks, the use of
   agile practices requires that the team and organization use also
   additional plan-driven practices to ensure the efficiency of external
   communication between all the actors of software development.},

Abstract = {Service-oriented computing (SOC) suggests that many open,
   network-accessible services will be available over the Internet for
   organizations to incorporate into their own processes. Developing new
   software systems by composing an organization's local services and
   externally-available web services is conceptually different from system
   development supported by traditional software engineering lifecycles.
   Consumer organizations typically have no control over the quality and/or
   consistency of the external services that they incorporate, thus
   top-down software development lifecycles are impractical. Software
   architects and designers will require agile, lightweight processes to
   evaluate tradeoffs in system design based on the `'estimated''
   responsiveness of external services coupled with known performance of
   local services. We introduce a model-driven software engineering
   approach for designing systems (i.e. workflows of web services) under
   these circumstances and a corresponding simulation-based evaluation
   tool.},

Title = {Spread pattern of the first dengue epidemic in the city of Salvador,
   Brazil},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {8},
Month = {FEB 7},
Abstract = {Background: The explosive epidemics of dengue that have been occurring
   in various countries have stimulated investigation into new approaches
   to improve understanding of the problem and to develop new strategies
   for controlling the disease. The objective of this study was to evaluate
   the characteristics of diffusion of the first dengue epidemic that
   occurred in the city of Salvador in 1995.
   Methods: The epidemiological charts and records of notified cases of
   dengue in Salvador in 1995 constituted the source of data. The cases of
   the disease were georeferenced according to census areas ( spatial
   units) and epidemiological weeks ( temporal unit). Kernel density
   estimation was used to identify the pattern of spatial diffusion using
   the R-Project computer software program.
   Results: Of the 2,006 census areas in the city, 1,400 ( 70\%) registered
   cases of dengue in 1995 and the spatial distribution of these records
   revealed that by the end of 1995 practically the entire city had been
   affected by the virus, with the largest concentration of cases occurring
   in the western region, composed of census areas with a high population
   density and predominantly horizontal residences compared to the eastern
   region of the city, where there is a predominance of vertical
   residential buildings.
   Conclusion: The pattern found in this study shows the characteristics of
   the classic process of spreading by contagion that is common to most
   infectious diseases. It was possible to identify the epicenter of the
   epidemic from which centrifugal waves of the disease emanated. Our
   results suggest that, if a more agile control instrument existed that
   would be capable of rapidly reducing the vector population within a few
   days or of raising the group immunity of the population by means of a
   vaccine, it would theoretically be possible to adopt control actions
   around the epicenter of the epidemic and consequently reduce the
   incidence of the disease in the city. This finding emphasizes the need
   for further research to improve the technology available for the
   prevention of this disease.},

Abstract = {In-depth investigation of the phase-noise behavior of injection-locked
   oscillators and analog frequency dividers is presented. An analytical
   formulation has been obtained, which allows a better understanding of
   the shape of the output phase-noise spectrum of these circuits. The
   simplicity of this formulation is also helpful for circuit design.
   Approximate expressions for the corner frequencies of the spectrum are
   determined, identifying the most influential magnitudes and deriving
   design criteria. In particular, a technique has been developed to shift
   the frequency of the first corner of the phase-noise spectrum, up to
   which the output phase noise follows the input one. The expressions for
   the corner frequencies can be introduced in either in-house or
   commercial harmonic-balance software, thus allowing an agile design, as
   no separate phase-noise analysis is required. The validity of the
   analytical techniques is verified with the conversion-matrix approach
   and with measurements using two field-effect-transistor-based circuits:
   a 4.9-GHz injection-locked oscillator and a frequency divider by 2 with
   9.8-GHz input frequency.},

Abstract = {Agile methods continue to gain popularity. In particular, the Scrum

   evidence of the challenges in the adoption of Agile methods in general,
   and Scrum in particular. Little, if anything, is empirically known about
   the application and adoption of Scrum in a multi-team and multi-project
   situation. The authors carried out an ethnographically informed
   longitudinal case study in industrial settings and closely followed how
   the Scrum method was adopted in a 20-person department, working in a
   simultaneous multi-project R\&D environment. Altogether 10 challenges
   pertinent to the case of multi-team multi-project Scrum adoption were
   identified in the study. The authors contend that these results carry
   great relevance for other industrial teams. Future research avenues

   evaluate this approach. The study involved 14 individual participants
   plus a five member agile team. The individual evaluation suggested that
   in general, the tool is usable with minor issues to be considered in
   future design revisions. The agile team evaluation revealed a
   significant interest in the tool and its added benefits to the agility
   of the planning meeting with some issues to be further enhanced.},

Abstract = {This paper traces BabyCenter's journey from chaos to a relatively mature
   Agile organization. Four years ago the BabyCenter team was tasked with
   more projects than actual developers while delivery dates were set long
   before projects were scoped or staffed. Multitudinous business
   stakeholders had direct access to team members, deluging them with
   requests for projects, each more urgent than the previous (in progress,
   yet unfinished) one. Now, four years later, the team has evolved into
   Sprints with predictable, steady velocities and a comprehensive planning
   process wrapping the Scrum Sprints.},

Abstract = {The ability of agile practices to scale to ``large{''} software
   development efforts (more than three teams or 30 team members) has been
   widely debated in recent years. nile a variety of inhibitors to scaling
   agile are frequently cited, this experience report describes how the
   primary challenge to scaling agile that we faced was finding the right
   people to build our agile tribe. The effective adoption of Agile
   requires passionate, motivated individuals who accept change, think like
   a business owner, operate willingly outside team walls, and identify and
   drive program issues. Finding such a large number of people with these
   qualities is much more difficult than establishing methods to support
   communications, progress tracking, and other agile practices. We
   conclude by describing the attributes of the type of person that we
   believe will thrive in a large-scale Agile shop.},

Abstract = {My overall approach to software development has been to decompose large
   efforts into smaller, tractable components, and to fail fast when things
   appear to be heading in the wrong direction. Though not a particularly
   unusual model, I have been able to road-test it over eight years of
   agile experience, including a stint at DaimerChrysler on an Extreme
   Programming (XP) team that included some of the members of the original
   C3 payroll project. This pattern has been a keystone of our direction at
   the Technology division of Entertainment Publications, where we began
   our agile transformation about two years ago. Though it was originally a
   small pilot with an unspecified roll-out plan, we now use an agile
   approach for all our software development and support. This paper
   highlights the lessons we've learned in the process some items for you

   physical devices among others. We then show how we managed to overcome
   these by adapting Scrum and mapping it unto our current process in such
   a way as to continue to satisfy the strict standard and regulations. We
   show how we automated the testing of physical devices to overcome our
   dependence on manual testing. We present the tools we used for managing
   requirement, validation, reporting and performance metrics. Finally we
   briefly look at the implications of the proposed IEC62304 standard on
   software development with Scrum.},

   specifically address the latter challenge, we created a lightweight
   release framework in order to optimize on-time, high quality delivery to
   our customers and partners.
   The fundamentals of this framework and approach emphasize supporting and
   enabling the development teams rather than controlling them, through a
   release framework--simple, lightweight, unambiguous, visible everywhere.
   By implementing this lightweight release framework and making it highly
   visible, we've promoted rhythm and flow within and across all scrum
   teams. In doing so, we have been able to develop a stable rhythm for
   delivering on-time, high-quality releases in a complex environment,

Abstract = {Those who implement agile software development and agile project
   management in a traditional corporate environment may encounter legacy
   corporate and IT processes that reflect legacy mindsets and cultures.
   These remnant processes, mindsets, and cultures represent opportunities
   to improve the systemic value that agile approaches are capable of
   enabling.
   For example, in many large corporations the annual budgeting cycle
   drives a mindset that scope, budget, and schedule must be established up
   front, often many months before project work begins. Success means
   delivering on that scope within the budget and schedule commitments.
   In turn, this mindset of defining business investment opportunities
   upfront, coupled with a project mentality where work must be completed
   before the next budgeting cycle begins, drives ``big batch{''}
   (waterfall-type) project approaches and supporting IT processes.
   As our IT teams successfully applied agile methods at the project level,
   we began to address our approach for managing portfolios of projects to
   increase the amount of value we deliver with our business partners. As
   we did this, we ran headlong into inherent conflicts between agile and
   legacy corporate processes and mindsets.
   We recognized the need to transform those legacy processes and mindsets
   so that we manage the portfolios of project investments in an agile
   manner. This paper describes the challenges we faced as we applied agile
   methods to IT investment funding, change management, and governance; the
   success and failures we experienced; what we learned; and how we adapted
   to improve.},

Abstract = {Many agile teams use Continuous Integration (CI). It is one of the
   Extreme Programming practices and has been broadly adopted by the
   community {[}1]. Just how effective is it? Does the effort of
   maintaining the CI server and fixing build breaks save time compared to
   a lengthier check-in process that attempts to never break the build?
   While much anecdotal evidence exists as to the benefits of CI there is
   very little in the way of data to support this. How do you convince
   teams and management that it's worth adopting and how best to do it?
   This report outlines our experience with CI in a distributed team
   environment and attempts to answer these questions.},

Abstract = {The use of automated build and continuous integration systems by
   software teams is a well-established practice, and has been shown to
   provide significant benefits. However to qualify the value of continuous
   integration practices it is necessary to compare their cost with the
   associated benefit. When considering automated builds or continuous
   integration in an agile team, this cost is the time taken by developers
   to run the build script and automated tests before code can be committed
   and/or deployed. This paper discusses the effect of this time on team
   behaviour by comparing two projects with significantly different build
   times.},

Abstract = {In 2006, Salesforce.com took a big bang approach to implementing the
   Adaptive Development Methodology (ADM): a unique blend of Scrum-style
   project management and the agile software development framework. The
   result was a huge success. In just three months, an R\&D department
   consisting of 200 employees and 30 teams transitioned from a traditional
   waterfall-style approach to ADM. Less than sixteen months later, the
   company had realized a 37\% increase in productivity.
   The rapid transition of ADM precipitated massive changes in how product
   managers work, interact with members of others departments, and manage
   dependencies between teams. This report details some of the challenges
   they faced, how they handled them, and how ADM has helped Product
   Managers become more effective.},

Abstract = {In early 2007, ChannelAdvisor undertook an ambitious project to
   rearchitect one of its core product offerings. Flush with early success
   from rapid customer adoption, the foundation for this product had grown
   well beyond its initial design. As defects grew in frequency and
   severity, pressure mounted to ``fix it yesterday{''}, but consensus on
   exactly how proved elusive. ``Fix it right{''} ideals battled with ``fix
   it now{''}, ultimately resulting in a new architecture that was
   inefficient, incomplete, and, after 3 long months of ``working harder,
   not smarter{''}, cancelled. In this experience report 1 will recap my
   experience as a product development manager sponsoring this project;
   revealing how the project went awry, what the team learned, and how the
   utilization of the Scrum process not only created a scalable, reliable
   architecture, but also greatly improved the ongoing productivity and

Abstract = {In 2007 the decision to broaden the adoption of Scrum to all development
   teams forced Kelley Blue Book (KBB) to seek out a more efficient and
   effective Scrum Tool. KBBs use of SharePoint was nascent at the time and
   was a fine tool for several small Scrum teams. However with the total
   number of teams now at fifteen, SharePoint alone was just not keeping
   pace with the needs of the organization. Deciding to move to a more
   robust tool to promote agility while keeping up with product release
   plans can be a complicated challenge. KBB chose VersionOne to replace
   SharePoint. Migration to VersionOne involved numerous departments and
   two offshore facilities. With KBB sharing their experience of this
   common situation, other companies can learn about and adopt proven
   techniques to ensure a successful tool migration. This paper will cover
   KBB's Scrum implementation, goals of tool migration, the selection
   process, migration approach, and results.},

Abstract = {Last fall I received an email with the software requirements from a
   potential customer that would establish us in an important new market.
   We had been brought in when the client had only two months left before
   deploying their chosen solution. The customer requirements list is vague
   and long, but the prize is big. Could we design and deploy major
   functionality in just two months? Thanks to agile development and some
   fortunate circumstances, our team of four delivered the functionality,
   won the deal, pleased the users, and didn't work an hour of overtime.},

Abstract = {This experience report describes how an Agile delivery team and Product
   Designer become progressively more sophisticated with product design and
   product innovation over the course of three separate software products.
   The team learned that despite having on-time product deployments and
   loads of high-priority features, customers were satisfied but not
   thrilled unless there was product design and innovation. This report
   introduces the techniques the team used to inject innovation into its
   software, products and tells the story how even a small amount of effort
   spent on product design and innovation can make a big difference in
   customer satisfaction.},

Abstract = {The Method for Method Configuration (MMC) has been proposed as a method
   engineering approach to tailoring software development methods. Ibis
   paper evaluates MMC during three software development projects where it
   was used to tailor eXtreme Programming (XP). The study has been
   justified by the need to complement earlier evaluations of MMC and
   providing more conclusive tests to determine the effectiveness of the
   meta-method in practice. Also, since MMC originates from the plan-based
   method community, no tests have so far been made on agile methods. Many
   method engineering concepts have similar roots and it is of interest to
   evaluate their applicability also in the agile context. We report on the
   migration results together with lessons learned.},

Abstract = {Much has been written about adopting agile software development within a
   large organisation. A key aspect of this significant organisational
   change is to ensure that a common understanding of the new technology
   emerges within all stakeholder groups. We propose that an analysis
   framework based on the concept of Technological Frames (TFs) can
   identify where understanding is in conflict across different stakeholder
   groups. We used TFs to analyse data collected in one organisation in the
   process of adopting an agile development approach. In doing so, we
   identified several dimensions (called I elements' in TFs) which
   characterise a group's understanding of agility. In this paper, we
   present these elements and describe the TFs for four distinct groups. We
   suggest that these elements may be used by other organisations adopting
   agile methods to help understand the views of different stakeholder
   groups.},

   some object-oriented metrics of the system, and their behavior related
   to the agile practices adoption level is presented and discussed,
   showing that software quality, as measured using standard 00 metrics,
   looks directly related to agile practices adoption.},

Abstract = {The appearance of Agile methods has been the most noticeable change to
   software process thinking in the last fifteen years {[}16], but in fact
   many of the ``Agile ideas{''} have been around since 70's or even
   before. Many studies and reviews have been conducted about Agile methods
   which ascribe their emergence as a reaction against traditional methods.
   In this paper, we argue that although Agile methods are new as a whole,
   they have strong roots in the history of software engineering. In
   addition to the iterative and incremental approaches that have been in
   use since 1957 {[}21], people who criticised the traditional methods
   suggested alternative approaches which were actually Agile ideas such as
   the response to change, customer involvement, and working software over
   documentation. The authors of this paper believe that education about
   the history of Agile thinking will help to develop better understanding
   as well as promoting the use of Agile methods. We therefore present and
   discuss the reasons behind the development and introduction of Agile
   methods, as a reaction to traditional methods, as a result of people's
   experience, and in particular focusing on reusing ideas from history.},

Abstract = {Over the last seven years we have been using eXtreme Programming (XP) in
   two commercial software development settings within the University of
   Sheffield. The detailed performance of a variety of different project
   teams has been analysed by the Sheffield Software Engineering
   Observatory - a joint research project between the Department of
   Computer Science and the Institute of Work Psychology - during this
   period, based on empirical data collected from these projects. A number
   of research questions have been investigated: the comparison between XP
   and a traditional software development approach in terms of product
   quality and the impact on quality of the number of XP practices used
   etc. Problems associated with some aspects of XP have been identified
   and adaptations and development of the XP methodology have been
   introduced. Other issues studied in the Observatory include the
   relationship between methodology and individual well being; the impact
   of personality on project outcomes; the level of conflict in different
   groups; the relationships between customers and programmers and issues
   relating to testing. The possible benefits of XP have been assessed
   alongside the problems with implementing the methodology in a variety of
   settings. `People' issues are a major determinant in successfully
   adopting the XP approach in a sustainable way. This paper is a brief
   review of some of this work.},

Abstract = {Agile Methods are becoming each day a more and more frequently used
   alternative among software developing organizations producing
   high-quality products in real-world projects. Despite this growth in
   industry, few academic institutions provide courses related to this new

   introducing agile method concepts through a Master's Degree course where
   the students had not experienced XP before. In spite of being MSc
   students they had previous software development background in industry
   environment. In this work we present how the issues found over the
   process may and have been handled as well as the benefits found; how the
   XP practices have been adapted and applied in a project with time,
   personnel, and skill constraints and what hindered some principles from
   being fully effective. We also present real results and open problems
   for further studies from this experience. The study used a real-life
   application taken from a need of a real software development company.},

   software development and presents data from a seven month ethnographic
   study of professional developers in a Scrum team. We found the most
   important barrier to be the highly specialized skills of the developers
   and the corresponding division of work. In addition we found a lack of
   system for team support, and reduced external autonomy to be important
   barriers for introducing self-organizing teams. These findings have
   implications for software development managers and practitioners.},

Abstract = {In global software development (GSD) projects, distributed teams
   collaborate to deliver high-quality software. Project managers need to
   control these development projects, which increasingly adopt agile
   practices. However, in a distributed project a major challenge is to
   keep all team members aware of recent changes of requirements and
   project status without providing too little or too much information for
   each role. In this paper we introduce a framework to define notification
   for development team members that allows a) measurement of notification
   effectiveness, efficiency, and cost; b) formalizing key communication in
   an agile environment; and c) providing a method and a tool to implement
   communication Support. We illustrate, with an example scenario from an
   industry background, the concept and report results from an initial
   empirical evaluation. From the evaluation it follows that the concept
   allows determining and increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of
   key communication in a global software development project in a
   sufficiently formal way without compromising the use of agile practices.},

Abstract = {Software customers want both sufficient product quality and agile
   response to requirements changes. Formal software requirements tracing
   helps to systematically determine the impact of changes and to keep
   track of development artifacts that need to be re-tested when
   requirements change. However, full tracing of all requirements on the
   most detailed level can be very expensive and time consuming. In the
   paper an initial ``tracing activity model{''} is introduced along with a
   framework that allows measuring the expected cost and benefit of tracing
   approaches. In a feasibility study a subset of the activities belonging
   to the model has been applied to compare three tracing strategies:
   agile, ``just in time{''} tracing, and fully formal tracing. The study
   focused on re-testing and it has been performed in the context of an
   industry project where the customer was a large financial service
   provider. In the study a) the model was found useful to capture costs
   and benefits of the tracing activities and to compare different
   strategies; b) a combination of tracing approaches proved helpful in
   balancing agility and formalism.},

Abstract = {One of the most important phases regarding Software Project Management
   is planning. On this phase, efforts and resources estimation must be
   taken into account considering human, materials, infrastructure, time,
   and budget. Generally, it depends on technical, environmental, human and
   political factors. It also can affect software final cost and
   development effort. The estimation tackled on this work was based on Use
   Case Points (UCP) effort estimation technique, introduced by Gustav
   Kamer in 1993. This paper considered both the best and the worst
   scenarios for developing a software product. It helped to verify and
   reveal which are the activities that may cause project lateness. The
   major contribution of this work was to provide acceptable software
   estimation for avionics system development and case study integration
   for an Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Project. The UCP effort estimation
   was applied to just one UAS named Preliminary Testing Monitoring Station
   (PTMS). That system was considered as a key part of the UAS Project. The
   strategy to get accurate estimate was the utilization of a well-defined
   software process, where documentation was continuously improved. This
   work has adopted Rational Unified Process (RUP), Unified Modeling
   Language (UML), and Object-Orientation (00). RUP has a specific artifact
   for use case models and the estimation was accomplished by taking
   information from this artifact. Another contribution of this work was
   the development of a software tool based upon the UCP technique. At the
   end, this paper reports significant estimate results to help project
   managers taking important decisions throughout the project development
   life-cycle.},

Abstract = {Component-based software engineering has had great impact in the desktop
   and server domain and is spreading to other domains as well, such as
   embedded systems. Agile software development is another approach which
   has gained much attention in recent years, mainly for smaller-scale
   production of less critical systems. Both of them promise to increase
   system quality, development speed and flexibility, but so far little has
   been published on the combination of the two approaches. This paper
   presents a comprehensive analysis of the applicability of the agile
   approach in the development processes of 1) COTS components and 2)
   COTS-based systems. The study method is a systematic theoretical
   examination and comparison of the fundamental concepts and
   characteristics of these approaches. The contributions are: first, an
   enumeration of identified contradictions between the approaches, and
   suggestions how to bridge these incompatibilities to some extent.
   Second, the paper provides some more general comments, considerations,
   and application guidelines concerning the introduction of agile
   principles into the development of COTS components or COTS-based
   systems. This study thus forms a framework which will guide further
   empirical studies.},

Abstract = {Agile software development methods mainly aim at increasing software
   quality by fostering customer collaboration and performing exhaustive
   testing. The introduction of Extreme Programming (XP) - the most common
   agile software development method - into an organization is accompanied
   with conceptual and organizational changes. These changes range from
   daily-life changes (e.g., sitting together and maintaining an
   informative project environment) and continue with changes on the
   management level (e.g., meeting and listening to the customer during the
   whole process and the concept of the whole team which means that all
   role holders are part of the team). This paper examines the process of
   transition to an agile development process in a large-scale software
   project in the Israeli Air Force as it is perceived from the system
   analysis and design perspective. Specifically, the project
   specifications of the agile team are compared with those of a team who
   continues working according to the previous heavyweight method during
   the first half year of transition. Size and complexity measures are used
   as the basis of the comparison. In addition to the inspection of the
   specifications, the change in the role of the system analysts, as the
   system analysts conceive of it, is examined.},

   this gap, we have chosen to use a commercial grade process framework:
   Rational Unified Process (R) (RUP) for the backbone of our newly
   introduced software engineering capstone project. The capstone project
   is required for all students and offered through the senior year of our
   ABET-accredited BS in Computer Science program. In our opinion, this
   will prepare students better for the competitive job market.},

Abstract = {The emergence of agile software development methodologies, and the sheer
   number of the variants introduced, has raised the need for evaluation
   and comparison efforts, mostly in order to facilitate the selection or
   engineering of an agile methodology aimed at a specific software
   development situation. But existing evaluation frameworks and comparison
   tools do not satisfy all the needs of project managers and method
   engineers. The principal objectives of this paper are to introduce a
   fundamental basis for evaluation frameworks that target existing
   challenges, and also to evaluate existing evaluation frameworks in order
   to identify their shortcomings. To this aim, we have proposed an
   evaluation criterion set, or metacriteria, according to which existing
   evaluation frameworks have been assessed. These meta-criteria define the
   essential features that an appropriate evaluation framework is expected
   to possess. The evaluation results show that existing evaluation
   frameworks do not satisfy typical requirements, and fail to address
   existing challenges. Therefore, the need still remains for an
   appropriate and useful evaluation framework for appraising agile
   methodologies.},

Abstract = {Software engineering tools have regained interests in recent years due
   to different changes affecting software developing organizations. These
   organizations carry out activities that might be undertaken in a plan
   driven and agile manner with the support of such tools. A proper balance
   between both approaches and the effective tool adoption will help
   organizations to meet their objectives and evolve. Small and medium
   enterprises and Cooperatives (S\&C) share common characteristics
   throughout Latin America. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) lack of
   formality in their roles and relationships among interacting
   individuals, whereas Cooperatives are usually small companies with
   weaknesses as to management techniques and technological equipment. In
   fact, both have difficulties when finding the right personnel and tools
   that best suit their needs. Considering Venezuela as our study subject,
   we have herein proposed some criteria to assist S\&C in the tools
   selection that support their development processes while fostering the
   balance required between agility and discipline. Such criteria were
   formulated based on the characterization of five factors aimed at
   determining this balance. These contributions will help subsequently
   identifying methodological and technical aspects to provide guidance to
   S\&C in the improvement of their development processes.},

Abstract = {Recently, an agile software development technique called extreme
   programming has caught the attention of practitioners and researchers in
   the software industry. A core practice of extreme programming is pair
   programming, where two developers work on the same piece of code. We
   introduce the problem of assigning pairs of developers to modules so as
   to maximize the commonality -a measure of the extent to which common
   developers work on related modules -subject to a load-balancing
   constraint that is motivated by the need to control the completion time
   of the project. We consider two variants of this problem. In MCAP(n), a
   developer is teamed up with exactly one other developer to form a pair
   that works together for the entire duration of the project. In MCAP(s),
   we allow a developer to pair with more than one other developer during
   the project. This ``pair-splitting{''} version of the problem
   facilitates knowledge dissemination among developers, but can increase
   the effort needed for a developer to adjust to the work habits of
   several partners.
   The difference between the commonality achieved with and without pair
   splitting crucially depends on the underlying structure of the problem.
   For trees, we show that the value of the maximum commonality is the same
   for both MCAPn and MCAPs. Additionally, we obtain polynomial-time
   algorithms for both of these variants. For general graphs, both problems
   MCAPn and MCAPs are shown to be strongly NP-complete. We prove that the
   maximum commonality for MCAPs is at most 3 2 times the maximum
   commonality of MCAPn. We also provide polynomial-time algorithms and
   approximation results for a number of special cases of these problems.},

Abstract = {The development of miniature, light-duty and low power consumption
   satellite-borne new concept devices based on MOEMS has significant
   meaning to realize forming inter-satellite network and minimizing,
   integrating, intellectualizing the payload of satellite-borne laser
   communication system. Agile beam steering control system based on MOEMS
   can realize the large FOV, high precision, agile response trace and
   optical axis alignment for multiple targets in spatial optoelectronic
   system. Comparing to traditional technology, agile beam steering control
   system lower the volumes, reduce the weight and power. In this article,
   ANSYS thermal analysis software is used to simulate the thermal
   distortion of the micro-mirrors on the MOEMS. ZEMAX optical analysis
   software is used to simulate the outgoing beam before and after the
   distortion of the mirrors. Under certain conditions, high power laser
   beam will have thermal effect on the reflector based on the reflective
   MOEMS APT precise steering device. The simulation results show that: the
   thermal distortion of the micro-mirror is tiny when radiated by low
   power laser, the influence can be neglected. However, when the laser
   power increasing, the receiving power decreased, the system performance
   degraded. In order to mitigate the negative influence, relevant method
   must be adopted.},

Abstract = {There is an increased frequency in the adoption of agile practices
   without the necessary education as to how or why particular practices
   are chosen. We view such applications as a ``band aid{''} approach that,
   more often than not, is a one-time fix to address problematic symptoms.
   This approach itself is also problematic because it fails to convey the
   rationale and principles necessary to accommodate future changes. In
   response to this observation and disquieting trend, we propose a
   Value-Driven Agile Adoption (VDAA) approach that mandates the
   consideration of three value-based components when introducing agile
   practices. These three components represent values defined by (1) the
   agile community, (2) corporate identity and (3) business objectives.
   Consideration of each is accompanied by the rationale for the inclusion
   of some practices, and the exclusion of others. The VDAA approach
   embraces the philosophy that Agile is more than just a development
   process - it is a way to help organizations respond to long-term, as
   well as short-term changes.},

Abstract = {KBoard is a software environment developed to facilitate group work
   conducted in multimedia collaboration rooms. Specifically, KBoard has
   been designed to support the process of capturing knowledge during group
   sessions in which interaction among participants is mediated by large
   interactive displays. We focus on two main requirements arising in this
   selling: (1) Users need agile and unobtrusive means to persistently
   represent their ideas and build associations among them; and (2) Users
   need to easily enter text without relying on conventional mouse and
   keyboard facilities. KBoard addresses these needs by (1) implementing
   the notion of workspaces that are built and inter-linked as discussion
   progresses and knowledge is shared by group members; and (2) providing
   alternative dynamic QWERTY and pie-menu virtual keyboards that speed up
   text input. As per our preliminary evaluation of KBoard, this
   combination results in a powerful environment that facilitates knowledge
   capture and offers an appealing toolset to explore more fully the
   potential of large interactive displays and to promote the adoption of
   multimedia collaboration rooms to support creative group activities.},

Abstract = {The principles behind the agile development methods and common practise
   within the Open Source community are vastly different. In recent years
   there has been a rise of interest in these, in order to detect and
   inform on areas of compatible shared practises. This paper argues that
   it is possible to quantify the level of agility displayed by Open Source
   projects. An indicator of agility, the Mean Developer Engagement (MDE)
   metric is introduced and tested through the analysis of public project
   data. Projects sampled from two repositories (KDE and SourceForge) are
   studied and a hypothesis is formulated: projects from the two samples
   display a similar level of MDE.
   This paper provides two main contributions: first, the MDE metric is
   shown to vary significantly between the KDE and SourceForge projects.
   Second, by combining MDE with a project's lifespan, it is also shown
   that SourceForge projects have insufficient uptake of new developers
   resulting in more active, shorter, initial activity, and in a quicker
   ``burning out{''} of the projects.},

Abstract = {The development of Web applications is an important focus of the modern
   information enabled organization - whether the Web application
   development is in-house, outsourced, or purchased as
   `commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software. Traditionally Web application
   development has been delivered via the dominant waterfall system. The
   waterfall system relies upon well-defined governance structures, linear
   phases, gating, and extensive reporting and sign-off documentation. An
   increasing number of development stakeholders criticise the waterfall
   system for web application development. The criticisms include a
   disproportionate focus on governance and process at the direct expense
   of flexibility and, most importantly, reduced productivity. One
   consequence of these criticisms is the increasing adoption of Web
   application development via agile-system methods. This agile-system
   approach centres upon smaller design teams, fewer development phases,
   and shorter development time tables.
   This case study examines the implementation of the agile-system approach
   as used by a Small-to-Medium Enterprise (SME) software developer. The
   case study data collection involves interviews and observations across
   three different SME sources: project managers, Web application
   programmers, and customers. The case study analysis synthesises the
   experiences of these managers, programmers and customers to produce an
   overall assessment of the usefulness of Web application delivery via
   agile-system methods. The major conclusions from the case study are that
   a `defaulf agile-system approach may be tailored or fine-tuned to fit an
   individual developer's software process. This tailoring is based upon
   the developer's assessment of best practice from the overall
   agile-system methodology. This tailoring, however, delivers a software
   development process that exhibits efficiencies and risks. The
   efficiencies include a more fulfilling role for each development team
   member, greater richness and continuity in design, a simple management
   system that delivers key information on a timely basis to all
   stake-holders, and increased business and technical quality within the
   delivered application. The risks pivot upon experience levels, skills
   levels, and the quality of interaction within - and between - both the
   development team and customer organization.},

Abstract = {Requirement management is the most important as well as most neglected
   area of Software Engineering and Project management. 80\% projects get
   fall due to poor requirement gathering and tracking follow ups. In
   Process models which are being followed in Software Development
   requirement gathering process is considered a task. Web development
   having fast iterations and quick releases mostly follows agile model.
   The pace and principles of agile development do not allow developers to
   maintain a proper set of requirement documentation. As per agile
   manifesto client and developers being in face to face communication
   minimizes the need of client requirement documentation. The focus is
   totally on the development and delivery to client in minimum time
   period. So documentation importance has not been realized in this
   scenario. But case is different in distributed agile based development,
   where development resources and client are globally at different
   locations without any direct and face to face communication. Thus there
   arises the need of maintaining minimum documentation related to client
   requirement and tracking to meet and fulfill the client requirements.
   Proper documentation helps developers to keep track of the client
   requirements so that they could not miss even a minor task. Therefore,
   light weight process needs to be introduced so that developers could
   follow the process of requirement gathering and tracking without putting
   extra time and effort during their fast paced development.
   A light weight process for requirement gathering and tracking in
   distributed agile development is proposed in this research. The process
   proposed requires minimum resources and very small documentation besides
   the actual development process. This process improves the client's
   satisfaction and performance of the developers. It also bridges the
   communication gap between client and developers.},

Abstract = {Agile software development is gaining popularity in industry. Anecdotal
   evidence to support this includes the emergence of agile practitioner
   journals and increasing attendance at agile-focused conferences. Many
   organizations are using agile methods because previously used techniques
   were not effective.
   Pair programming is probably the best known agile practice. Although
   controversial in both industry and academe, its use in education has
   been increasing, particularly in CS1. While some instructors fear that
   students may get a `free ride' when pairing, empirical evidence shows
   that this is not the case. CS1 students who pair do as well in CS2 as
   students who worked by themselves in CS1, even when working alone in CS2
   {[}1]. Pairing in CS1 leads to greater retention in the CS major, and
   also shows promise at reducing the gender gap in computing - the
   increase in retention among paired students is greater for women than it
   is for men {[}2].
   The members of this panel argue that many other agile techniques can be
   used effectively in the CS curriculum. Collectively, we have more than
   60 years of industrial experience; we feel that this gives us a clear
   understanding of the realities faced by students as they enter the
   workforce. Because of this, we strongly believe that students should be
   extensively exposed to agile practices.
   We have successfully taught agile techniques in courses ranging from
   introductory programming to the senior capstone. The benefits of this
   include increased student confidence and successful project delivery. We
   believe that agile techniques can be applied fruitfully in many other
   parts of the curriculum.},

Abstract = {This article reports four consecutive semesters of continuous effort to
   refine an Information Systems (IS) development course in a public
   university. The course seeks to impart IS undergraduates, future
   Information Technology (IT) professionals, on the importance of agility,
   flexibility and adaptability in enterprise-level software development.
   Several unique characteristics of the course include (1) the emphasis on
   team-based guidance rather than traditional lecture-based teaching, (2)
   the stress on providing working, integrated software solution, (3) the
   value of adopting progressive and flexible method of software

Abstract = {Within the field of Software Engineering emergence of agile methods has
   been a hot topic since the late 90s. eXtreme Programming (XP) ({[}1])
   was one of the first agile methods and is one of the most well-known.
   However research has pointed to weaknesses in XP regarding supporting
   development of viable architectures. To strengthen XP in this regard a
   new practice: Developer Stories ({[}2]) was introduced in 2006 - mainly
   based on a theoretical augmentation
   This paper reports from extensive experimentation with, and elaboration
   of the new practice. Results from this experimentation shows that using
   Developer Stories increases the likelihood of developing a viable
   architecture through a series of deliberate choices, through creating
   disciplined and recurring activities that: 1) Facilitate sharing and
   embodying of knowledge about architectural issues, and 2) heighten
   visibility of refactorings for both customers and developers.},

Abstract = {Due to the complexity and size of embedded software together with strong
   demands on time-to-market and quality, testing is a crucial point that
   should be addressed during software development. Traditionally, testing
   is carried out during the last phases of the software development life
   cycle. As a consequence, testing activities are often subject to high
   time pressure, which either results in delayed market introduction or
   low product quality. The validation of functional and real-time
   requirements of embedded systems is a difficult task. It usually needs
   the electronic control unit and the controlled hardware components. But
   very often the hardware components are not available for testing the
   control software at the beginning of the development.
   In this paper, we paper presents how test cases can be designed from use
   cases and how embedded control software can be validated without
   hardware components by simulating the test cases in early development
   phases using the AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming). For achieving an
   aspect oriented testable format, extended UML sequence diagrams are
   applied to formalize sequences of events, which have been specified in
   the use case scenarios. Provided that black box aspect oriented is used
   for developing embedded component applications, the monitoring of the
   dynamic behavior inside the components is not possible during
   simulation. But the simulated dynamic behavior is observable on the
   connections between the software components. In such a way monitored and
   recorded time stamp events axe finally compared offline against the
   expected sequences of events specified in the test cases. The offline
   comparison validates the simulated behavior by demonstrating the
   fulfillment of user requirements and by detecting errors in case of
   contradictions during modeling.},

Abstract = {Key challenges of finding right skilled resources and the cost arbitrage
   factors have made distributed software development indispensable for
   quite some time now. The success stories of many offshore service
   providers particularly from India underlines the fact that this is
   working well in a ``hands-free{''} mode, especially for projects
   following traditional development life cycles. The recent trend is an
   increase in the number of organizations adopting agile methodologies to
   tackle the challenges of requirements volatility and shorter time to
   market. However, the concept of a collocated team which is central to
   agile does not easily translate to distributed development. This paper
   captures our experience at Wipro in handling Distributed Agile projects.
   We discuss a validated model to make a smooth transition from a
   collocated to a distributed scenario in agile projects. We also share
   the lessons learnt and best practices that we have gained in
   implementing this model.},

Abstract = {This paper describes a methodology that enterprises can use to adapt
   their software applications, both intra-net and inter-net systems, to
   the changes of their business environment. The methodology enables agile
   software development based on a Web process architecture that executes
   ontology-based business processes as workflow systems. Ontology
   construction technology is used to extract business model of tasks and
   processes from enterprise documents, model them, and organize them.
   Reflective semantics interoperates between RDF/XML representation of
   business tasks and Java objects of business process primitives. The gap
   between business models and enterprise software applications is bridged
   by a Java-based software framework that executes business process as a
   set of Web page transitions. As a result, a business model is
   implemented as a thin client application. The software framework enables
   rapid spiral development of short-term cycles because business modelers,
   software developers, and users are able to share the same framework of
   description and systems. The feasibility of the methodology described
   here has been demonstrated in projects developing local-government
   workflow systems.},

Abstract = {Agile processes play an important role in the author's undergraduate
   course in software engineering. The course is a required course for
   undergraduate majors in Computer Science. Agile processes, like extreme
   Programming (XP), have been criticized for not providing a good
   framework for building secure software. The course begins by covering
   what some people have called ``the war{''} between the traditional
   waterfall process folks and the agile process folks. After students are
   given an introduction to various processes on both sides of ``the
   war{''} (with an emphasis on PSP, CMMI and XP) and after students are
   introduced to basic concepts about how to make software systems more
   secure (drawing heavily on Viega and McGraw's book Building Secure
   Software), the course turns its attention to how XP (in particular) can
   be made more secure. This topic generates a lot of enthusiasm among the
   students. The students seem to enjoy the challenge of creating new ideas
   to improve the manner in which XP addresses security issues. Students
   have come up with many creative and stimulating ideas about how eXtreme
   Programming-can be made more secure without the necessity for what some
   have called ``big up front design{''}. This paper presents some of the
   creative ideas students have come up with regarding this issue and
   discusses the team projects that give students the opportunity to
   explore security issues for agile processes in some depth.},

Abstract = {Today, agile methods become a popular approach to develop software
   systems. They try to satisfy customer, respond to changes, release in
   less time and achieve suitable profits for developers. XP is one of the
   most popular agile methods which is currently being used and different
   kinds of research have been accomplished about its various aspects such
   as pair programming.. In spite of all benefits known of XP, it does not
   involve architectural techniques yet. As it is mentioned in many
   technical reports, the way to achieve high quality of system is to
   consider its architecture as an important matter in the development
   process. This paper introduces two practices in order to empower XP's
   development process toward improving system's architecture. The main
   characteristic of proposed solution is that it is derived from values
   and practices of XP in order to be compatible with XP process model and
   to keep its agility intact.},

   We argue that agile methodologies can be enhanced by the use of shadows
   as this feature because of its inherent ability to dynamically change
   the behavior of classes and objects, provides mechanisms to ease common
   tasks such as prototyping, deprecating, dynamic classification and
   interclassing at run-time. Therefore shadows should be considered a
   notion beyond any specific programming languages in order to facilitate
   its use in model-driven software engineering. For this we introduce
   Shadows-UML, an UML extension, that would help to push forward the
   convergence between model-driven and agile methodologies.},

Abstract = {In a competitive business landscape, large organizations such as
   insurance companies and banks are under high pressure to innovate,
   improvise and distinguish their products and services while continuing
   to reduce the time-to market for new product introductions. Generating a
   single view of the customer is vital from different perspectives of the
   systems developer over a period of time because of the existence of
   disconnected systems within an enterprise. Therefore, to increase
   revenues and cost optimization, it is important to build enterprise
   systems more closely with the business requirements by reusing the
   existing systems. While building distributed based applications, it is
   important to take into account the proven processes like Rational
   Unified Process (RUP) to mitigate risks and increase the reliability of
   systems. Experiences in developing applications in Java Enterprise
   Edition (JEE) with customized RUP have been presented in this paper. RUP
   is adopted into an onsite-offshore development model along with ISO 9001
   and SEI CMM Level 5 standards. This paper provides an RUP approach to
   achieve increased reliability with higher productivity and lower defect
   density along with competitiveness through cost effective custom
   software solutions.
   Quantitative software reliability prediction is done using Generalized
   Stochastic Petri Nets, based on the RUP implemented prototype obtained
   from the PoC of a financial application prior to the actual
   implementation of the application development.},

Abstract = {Modeling is a very important part of software engineering. Software
   developers have adopted Unified Modeling Language (UML) as de facto
   standard for graphical modeling of various aspects of software systems.
   Due to success of industrial UML adoption, multiple vendors have
   developed and Put to market numerous UML modeling tools. In July of this
   year, we will celebrate the 10 years anniversary from the first version
   of MagicDraw UML tool, which has been developed in Lithuania, and is one
   of the best-rated and most powerful UML tools worldwide. Although UML
   tools have already reached a high maturity level, there are still many
   issues that have to be solved and new ideas that are still not Supported
   in modeling environments. In this keynote, we will review the recent hot

Abstract = {A challenge with introducing agile software development is changing the
   way decisions are made. In this paper, we discuss the decision making
   processes used in Scrum teams. We found that a prerequisite for
   introducing Scrum is the alignment of decisions on a strategic, tactical
   and operational level. In addition, specialisation can be a barrier for
   the decision-making process on the operational level, and that daily
   meetings are important for preventing decision-hijacking. Also removing
   the hold-up problem makes it easier for developers to participate in the
   decision-making process.},

Abstract = {Increasingly, information systems must be developed and implemented as a
   part of business change. This is a challenge for the IS project manager,
   since business change and information systems development usually are
   performed as separate processes. Thus, there is a need to understand and
   manage the relationship between these two kinds of processes. To
   understand the interaction between information systems development and
   planned organizational change we introduce the concept of process
   interaction. We draw on a longitudinal case study of an IS development
   project that used an iterative and incremental development approach. The
   concept of process interaction enabled us to understand critical events
   in the case in particular those that were important for the mutual
   adaptation between the information system and the organization. We
   conclude that process interaction is needed to facilitate
   socio-technical innovation in a situation where the organizational
   change process and the IS development process are parallel but
   incongruent. We also argue that iterative software engineering
   frameworks are well structured to support process interaction. Finally,
   we advocate that the IS project manager needs to manage the trade-off
   between necessary process interaction and the internal IS project
   schedule.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the arguments for Creation and Validation of a
   Composite Process Framework (CASDPF) that would enable formal modeling
   and management of the Application Software Development \& Integration.
   The arguments for this research are based on the practical understanding
   of the authors that no single `type' of process appears to be suitable
   for software development projects. Increasingly, there appears to be a
   need to use high-ceremony `waterfall' type approaches at the programme
   and project management level, whereas at individual level, `agile'
   aspects of a process seem to help. A composite process framework has the
   potential for accepting this responsibility of balancing the modeling
   with software projects, as is argued in this paper. The development of
   software application systems, and management of the corresponding
   systems development life cycle is considered complex, time consuming and
   costly. This is so because, as argued by Unhelkar {[}5], the nature,
   type and size of software projects are different and so they result in
   differing requirements, development and implementation procedures..
   Marks {[}3] indicates that the Waterfall model does not provide good
   project planning control and risk management.
   According to Marks {[}3], the iterative process has many strengths such
   as rapid feedback from users based on the actual system prototype,
   flexibility to address system evolving requirements, the rapid discovery
   of design flaws, and ease of deploying new functionality. An iterative
   project might run the risk of never ending process, due to its ability
   to react to continuous changes of business needs, and incomplete system
   documentation due to the fact that there is no scheduled period for
   documentation.
   The agile methods are suitable for projects with requirements that are
   rapidly changing and not very suitable for systems that have high
   criticality, reliability and safety requirements {[}2]. Agile methods
   are evaluated based on project criticality, size and requirements. Boehm
   {[}1] Spiral life-cycle model that combines features of the prototyping
   and Waterfall model{[}4] is favored for large, expensive, and
   complicated projects.
   The following model as shown in (Figure 1). Shows that the Waterfall
   approach is best for project management as it gives the project manager
   full control over the project life-cycle. The iterative approach is the
   best during the analysis, design and implementation phases since it
   gives the project team more flexibility to address evolving system
   requirements and to iterate within these phases to ensure a
   comprehensive analysis and design has been done. The Agile approach is
   best during the implementation and testing phases since it helps produce
   incremental small software releases within a short iterative development
   cycles.
   The Composite approach will split the project into a set Of increments;
   each increment will consist of a set of the project life-cycle phases.
   For each increment, it will bring the best aspects of available software
   development processes (Waterfall, Iterative and Agile) together that can
   be used to develop and manage application software development.},

Abstract = {As web based-applications become increasingly important to all aspects
   of life, there is a need to encourage practitioners to adopt best
   practices so as to improve the quality of the processes in use, and
   therefore achieve targets related to time, budget and quality. The web
   development industry worldwide is dominated by a myriad of small firms.
   This presents a challenge in terms of determining the current practices
   of industry participants, and in devising improvement initiatives which
   are feasible for small firms. The objectives of this research is to
   propose a software process model framework that assists the small firms
   in designing web based-applications so as not to run over budget and
   time. To achieve these objectives, an extensive literature survey of web
   development methodologies and software process improvement in small
   firms were conducted to identify web engineering practice in web
   development. The literature survey clarified that, there were several
   development methodologies of web-based application. These studies have
   not taken into consideration software process improvements. A software
   process framework for internet development in small firms is proposed in
   this research This framework contains several steps to follow; the first
   step is to begin with small web project. The second steps is adopt the
   modified XP process model which is also a suggested process model for
   internet development in small firms, and then apply XXPM as a quality
   model for software process improvement. If the proposed software process
   framework is to be successful then it must be laid on web engineering
   practices.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an overview of the image-guided surgery toolkit
   (IGSTK). IGSTK is an open source C++ software library that provides the
   basic components needed to develop image-guided surgery applications. It
   is intended for fast prototyping and development of image-guided surgery
   applications. The toolkit was developed through a collaboration between
   academic and industry partners. Because IGSTK was designed for
   safety-critical applications, the development team has adopted
   lightweight software processes that emphasizes safety and robustness
   while, at the same time, supporting geographically separated developers.
   A software process that is philosophically similar to agile software
   methods was adopted emphasizing iterative, incremental, and test-driven
   development principles. The guiding principle in the architecture design
   of IGSTK is patient safety. The IGSTK team implemented a component-based
   architecture and used state machine software design methodologies to
   improve the reliability and safety of the components. Every IGSTK
   component has a well-defined set of features that are governed by state
   machines. The state machine ensures that the component is always in a
   valid state and that all state transitions are valid and meaningful.
   Realizing that the continued success and viability of an open source
   toolkit depends on a strong user community, the IGSTK team is following
   several key strategies to build an active user community. These include
   maintaining a users and developers' mailing list, providing
   documentation (application programming interface reference document and
   book), presenting demonstration applications, and delivering tutorial
   sessions at relevant scientific conferences.},

Abstract = {A radio frequency interference (RFI) excision algorithm based on
   spectral kurtosis, a spectral variant of time-domain kurtosis, is
   proposed and implemented in software. The algorithm works by providing a
   robust estimator for Gaussian noise that, when violated, indicates the
   presence of non-Gaussian RFI. A theoretical formalism is used that
   unifies the well-known time-domain kurtosis estimator with past work
   related to spectral kurtosis, and leads naturally to a single expression
   encompassing both. The algorithm accumulates the first two powers of M
   power spectral density (PSD) estimates, obtained via Fourier transform,
   to form a spectral kurtosis (SK) estimator whose expected statistical
   variance is used to define an RFI detection threshold. The performance
   of the algorithm is theoretically evaluated for different time-domain
   RFI characteristics and signal-to-noise ratios eta. The theoretical
   performance of the algorithm for intermittent RFI ( RFI present in R out
   of M PSD estimates) is evaluated and shown to depend greatly on the duty
   cycle, d = R/M. The algorithm is most effective for d = 1/( 4 + eta),
   but cannot distinguish RFI from Gaussian noise at any eta when d = 0.5.
   The expected efficiency and robustness of the algorithm are tested using
   data from the newly designed FASR Subsystem Testbed radio interferometer
   operating at the Owens Valley Solar Array. The ability of the algorithm
   to discriminate RFI against the temporally and spectrally complex radio
   emission produced during solar radio bursts is demonstrated.},

Journal = {INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {49},
Number = {6},
Pages = {552-563},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper presents a qualitative investigation of learning failures
   associated with the introduction of a new software development
   methodology by a project team. This paper illustrates that learning is
   more than the cognitive process of acquiring a new skill; learning also
   involves changes in behaviour and even beliefs. Extreme Programming
   (XP), like other software development methodologies, provides a set of
   values and guidelines as to how software should be developed. As these
   new values and guidelines involve behavioural changes, the study
   investigates the introduction of XP as a new learning experience.
   Researchers use the concepts of single and double-loop learning to
   illustrate how social actors learn to perform tasks effectively and to
   determine the best task to perform. The concept of triple-loop learning
   explains how this learning process can be ineffective, accordingly it is
   employed to examine why the introduction of XP was ineffective in the
   team studied. While XP should ideally foster double-loop learning,
   triple-loop learning can explain why this does not necessarily occur.
   Research illustrates how power factors influence learning among groups
   of individuals; this study focuses on one specific power factor - the
   power inherent in the desire to conform. The Abilene Paradox describes
   how groups can make ineffective decisions that are contrary to that
   which group members personally desire or believe. Ineffective
   decision-making occurs due to the desire to conform among group members;
   this was shown as the cause of ineffective learning in the software team
   studied. This desire to conform originated in how the project team
   cohered as a group, which was, in turn, influenced by the social values
   embraced by XP. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Agile software development methods are quickly being adopted by the
   software industry. Concerns have been raised whether agile methods are
   suitable for any given information systems development domain. Indeed,
   quite little is known empirically about the validity of agile methods in
   most of the industrial domains. Mobile information systems present no
   exception in this sense. Yet, they are subject to frequent requirements
   changes in terms of changing business needs and technology, and their
   market is highly competitive. Moreover, most of these systems are far
   away from so called agile home ground. This talk presents the need for
   agile methods in the focal domain, identifies their shortcomings on the
   basis of three large-scale case studies from industry. All of the cases
   deal with the development of mobile information system and come from
   Nokia, F-Secure and Philips. The talk also discusses the possible
   strategies for deploying agile solutions in practice.},

Abstract = {Design is an inherently multidisciplinary endeavor. This raises the
   question of how to develop systems in ways that can best leverage the
   perspectives, practices, and knowledge bases of these different areas.
   Agile software development and usability engineering both address
   important aspects of system design, but there are tensions between the
   methods that make them difficult to integrate. This work presents a
   development approach that draws from extreme programming (XP), a widely
   practiced agile software development process, and scenario-based design
   (SBD), an established usability engineering process. It describes three
   key questions that need to be addressed for agile software development
   methods and usability engineering practices to work together
   effectively, and it introduces interface architectures and design
   representations that can address these questions.},

Abstract = {This experience report describes a three year journey toward agility in
   a software engineering course. Students in the course work in small
   project teams to develop an application for a real client using the
   service-learning model. In the first year a formal plan-driven approach
   was used, and only two of four projects were completed successfully. A
   more agile approach was taken the second year, but there were still
   failing projects. In the third year a highly agile approach based on
   short iterations and user stories was used. This was more successful, as
   every project team delivered working software to their clients. This
   paper also discusses some of the challenges of managing and evaluating
   student work when using agile methods.},

Abstract = {In late 2005 we had the opportunity to start our first embedded
   development project. We apply agile practices to a variety of domains
   from web development to desktop applications to factory floor test
   equipment. The challenge for this new work was not learning the
   environment and technology. Our challenge was applying the practices of
   the agile world to the small and complex world of embedded systems. The
   hurdles were numerous: we battled the archaic state of many embedded
   tool sets, the lack of integration with tools like Rake that provide
   easy automation, and poor support for object oriented design. We've
   overcome each of these difficulties. This report is about our yearlong
   experience in introducing our development practices to embedded
   development.},

Abstract = {Fulfilling the potential of Agile development depends on people truly
   wanting to change how they work. Transitioning to new methods of
   development is particularly daunting in a large organization that
   already has a sizeable existing code base and a broad set of existing
   customers. In our experience, development teams tend to reach a plateau
   implementing a subset of Agile practices, and those tend to be generally
   focused on the planning and iterative aspects of Agile. This paper
   describes our experience in overcoming the barriers to increasing the
   adoption of Agile practices. Drawing from Agile principles, we have
   developed an approach for improvement that enables teams to accelerate
   change, deepen their degree of understanding, and increase their success
   in execution. We have found this helps teams to overcome the plateau
   effect.},

Abstract = {We had been developing software with a strict waterfall mentality for
   several years. Our testing cycle was broken up into distinct phases for
   functional, system and regression testing. One phase did not start until
   the previous one was completed Our testing team had always been a real
   asset to the organization. The entire team was a highly skilled group of
   automation testers using traditional, expensive off the sheaf automated
   testing software. As we switched over to agile development using the
   Scrum framework, we really struggled with how to incorporate our
   traditional automated testing strategies into the agile world. Is
   testing in a waterfall project really that different then testing in an
   agile project? Yss!},

   and India to the adjournment of the team after finishing the deployment
   to production on time without fuss. Topics include: how we worked in a
   distributed Agile 8-10 person team in San Francisco and London, how we
   used agile methods to track build and deployment tasks; how we worked in
   iterations, estimated the work for each iteration, and tracked velocity
   over time.},

   DTE Energy's Information Technology Services (ITS) organization
   continues to embrace and extend the agile mindset throughout its
   culture. Our organization first embraced agility eight years ago, and we
   continue to refine our agile methodologies as we deliver and support
   world-class business solutions. The more we apply agile methods to our

   as operational work.
   In this report we discuss our experiences applying agile methods outside
   of software development projects in a broader context of operational
   work and organizational leadership. We assert that agile principals and
   techniques associated with software development projects can be readily
   applied in other types of organizational work and in creating and
   sustaining an effective leadership culture.},

Abstract = {While British Telecom (BT) has been progressing the adoption of agile
   practices across teams for the last two years, the overall
   organizational transformation has been slow to emerge and a catalyst was
   needed. In November 2006, BT began running a series of one hundred
   person, one and a half day events called Joining the Dots 3, aimed at
   promoting the use of agile throughout the IT organization. The event's
   practical approach of embedding learning through the use of videos and
   activities on agile planning, user stories, customer collaboration and
   iterative delivery into a large scale end-to-end simulation has proven
   to be both fun and an excellent learning tool. Simulation retrospectives
   inside the event echo the learning points and feedback forms have
   confirmed that BT may have succeeded in generating large scale buy-in to
   using agile practices across thousands of people in their delivery
   organization.},

Abstract = {Unit testing is essential in the agile context. A unit test case written
   long ago may uncover an error introduced only recently, at a time at
   which awareness of the test and the requirement it expresses may have
   long vanished. Popular unit testing frameworks such as JUNIT may then
   detect the error at little more cost than the run of a static program
   checker (compiler). However, unlike such checkers current unit testing
   frameworks can only detect the presence of errors, they cannot locate
   them. With EZUNIT, we present an extension to the JUNIT ECLIPSE plug-in
   that serves to narrow down error locations, and that marks these
   locations in the source code in very much the same way syntactic and
   typing errors are displayed. Because EZUNIT is itself designed as a
   framework, it can be extended by algorithms further narrowing down error
   locations.},

Abstract = {Agile methods focus on customer satisfaction and delivering business
   value early, however if flexibility and adaptability are not managed
   during the development project, agile methods could not assure achieving
   the overall business expectations. Customers require risk visibility
   over the main aspects that define its expectations: functionality
   (scope), budget, time-to-market, and product quality. These risks must
   be controlled and monitored during the project in order to introduce
   mitigation actions if needed. In this article, we propose an agile
   commitments framework based on the definition and follow-up of
   commitments between customer and developer. This framework aims to
   improving risk management by enhancing business expectation risk
   visibility, and also providing a negotiation baseline between customers
   and developers.},

   differentiate the system into functional aspect and several technical
   aspects which give supports to the functional one. Different concerns
   need different programming paradigms. At the functional aspect, we takes
   declarative programming, and at the technical aspects procedural
   programming. An abstract machine, as a pivotal of the architecture,
   weaves all these aspects dynamically at runtime, to achieve all the
   functionalities of the system.},

Abstract = {Most industries and organizations use collections of tools, devices, and
   applications that are growing in complexity. New tools or applications
   may be acquired and old tools may become obsolete over time. They are
   often running on a variety of platforms, have different bandwidth and
   QoS requirements, and in most cases they cannot be accessed through a
   single point of entry. Moreover, some tools may require specific
   configurations done by technical experts. To address these issues, we
   propose an extensible, reliable, and simple software architecture that
   can hide the complexity of provisioning the network and running the
   tools. This paper introduces a service-oriented approach for creating an
   agile infrastructure to provision devices, applications, and their
   underlying networks.
   The Eucalyptus prototype is developed as an empirical application to
   test this approach. Eucalyptus is built on a set of generic fine-grained
   Web Services to manage and configure available resources, where new
   resources can be custom-built or imported from a third party. They can
   be integrated into Eucalyptus using a set of Web Service-enabled APIs.
   Our user community consists of architects and industrial designers.
   Eucalyptus can manage and configure the resources needed by
   geographically distributed groups of architects who need to collaborate
   in real time on the design of buildings, in a virtual Participatory
   Design Studio (PDS). Eucalyptus provides a single point of entry for the
   architects to access a wide variety of tools: videoconference
   applications, visualization services, rendering services employing
   parallel computers, etc. Eucalyptus provides a set of upper layer
   services for users to provision devices and applications running on
   high-speed broadband networks, as well as the commercial IT networks.},

Abstract = {The development of security-critical large-scale distributed software
   systems is a difficult and error prone process. As we learnt from
   practical experiences, it is especially difficult to manually define and
   manage security policies, for example for access control, with a
   sufficient level of assurance. The human security administrator is not
   able to cope with the high complexity of the interactions of the
   application and the low level, platform specific security policy.
   Therefore, a new approach is needed to improve the correctness of the
   security policies, and to make security policies manageable. This is
   particularly eminent in two areas: service-oriented architecture (SOA)
   style environments where agility support and reuse (also of policies!)
   are critical; and in environments where collaborative decision making
   (CDM) has to be implemented, which typically requires agile secure
   information sharing (especially sensitive cross-organisation between
   coalition partners). This paper shows how security engineering can be
   integrated into a model-driven software development process. In our
   approach, UML models of the application's functional properties are
   flexibly augmented with security relevant information. Together with a
   high level security policy defined by the security administrator, this
   augmented functional model is then used in an automatic model
   transformation to generate the platform specific security policy with
   high assurance. With this approach, which also supports the separation
   of concerns in model based software engineering, we can automatically
   generate security-critical applications for different middleware
   platforms like our SecureMiddleware, which is an extended implementation
   of the CORBA Components Model with improved support for properties like
   security. The concepts, platforms and tools presented in the paper are
   currently used for the development of several large-scale and secure
   applications, for example for building a Virtual Air-Space Management
   System with strong security requirements, and within the U.S. Naval
   Research Lab SINS project.},

Abstract = {Fujitsu Software Technologies (formerly Fujitsu Prime Software

   implement the basic concepts of TPS in the IT software field. We
   included the basic concepts of TPS (elimination of muda {[}waste],
   heijunka {[}leveled production], and fidoka {[}automatic detection of
   abnormal conditions]) and visual management in the agile development
   process and store management method as practical techniques. PST
   introduced this agile development process to its software development
   process and the store management method to support its maintenance
   process. As a result, PST achieved significant improvements in both
   processes and in its organizational climate. This paper introduces the
   TPS concepts employed in the agile development process, describes how
   heiiunka is used in the store management method, and examines the
   effects of implementing agile development and store management at PST.},

   it requires the adoption of a human-centered approach to software
   development. The inclusion of humans and their social context into the
   issues to consider throughout development deeply influences software
   development at large. Waterfall approaches are not feasible, since they
   are based on eliminating uncertainty from software development. On the
   contrary, the uncertainty of dealing with human beings, and their social
   or work context, makes necessary the introduction of uncertainty-based
   approaches into software development. HCI (Human-Computer Interaction)
   has a long tradition of dealing with such uncertainty during
   development, but most current software development practices in industry
   are not rooted in a human-centered approach. This paper revises the
   current roots of software development practices, illustrating how their
   limitations in dealing with uncertainty may be tackled with the adoption
   of well-known HCI practices.},

Abstract = {The lack of flexibility in software process modeling is an important
   drawback pointed out as the main cause for the low adoption of
   Process-centered Software Engineering Environments (PSEEs). The Object
   Management Group (OMG) has been working on the Software Process
   Engineering Meta-model (SPEM) in order to provide a uniform
   object-oriented meta-model for building software process models, like
   the Rational Unified Process (RUP). Nevertheless, the SPEM neither takes
   into account flexibility aspects nor provides a flexibility meta-model
   for derived software process models. This paper proposes a flexibility
   meta-model for building flexible SPEM-based software process models.
   SPEM compliant PSEEs that implement the proposed meta-model will provide
   the ability to build flexible software process models, and to associate
   distinct flexible mechanisms to their corresponding modeling elements.},

Abstract = {Within the field of Software Engineering emergence of agile methods has
   been a hot topic since the late 90s. eXtreme Programming (XP) (Beck,
   1999) was one of the first agile methods and is one of the most
   well-known. However research has pointed to weaknesses in XP regarding
   supporting development of viable architectures. To strengthen XP in this
   regard a new practice: Developer Stories (Jensen et al., 2006) was
   introduced last year mainly based on a theoretical argumentation.
   This paper reports from extensive experimentation with, and elaboration
   of the new practice. Results from this experimentation shows that using
   Developer Stories increases the likelihood of developing a viable
   architecture through a series of deliberate choices, through creating
   disciplined and recurring activities that: 1) Facilitate sharing and
   embodying of knowledge about architectural issues, and 2) heighten
   visibility of refactorings for both customers and developers.},

Abstract = {The increasing prevalence of service-oriented architecture (SOA) has
   introduced another layer of abstraction (service-oriented) on top of
   already well-known object-oriented and component-oriented layers of

   phase-based approach towards the development of SOA-based applications,
   contrarily, lacks agility, which mitigates against the needed ability to
   quickly respond to changes in business processes. Therefore, here, we
   suggest an agile approach to implement a flexible SOA. This paper, based
   on our industrial experience and case studies, presents the agile
   service-oriented process (ASOP) that had been constructed by using the
   agile software solution framework (ASSF), agile toolkit (ATK),

Abstract = {Agile software development methods have become increasingly popular
   since the late 1990s, and may offer improved outcomes for software
   development projects when compared to more traditional approaches.'
   However there has previously been little published empirical evidence to
   either prove or disprove this assertion. A survey carried out in March
   2006 gathered responses from a large number of software development
   professionals who were using many different methods, both traditional
   and agile. A statistical analysis of this data reveals that agile
   methods do indeed improve outcomes from software development projects in
   terms of quality, satisfaction, and productivity, without a significant
   increase in cost. However, adoption of methods appears to involve,a high
   degree of adaptivity, with many methods being used in combination and
   sets of techniques being adopted on an ad hoc basis. In this context,
   our analysis suggests that choosing specific combinations of methods can
   be particularly beneficial. However, we also find that successful
   adoption of an agile method is to some extent dependent on rigorous
   integration of certain core techniques.},

Abstract = {Although systems development methodologies (SDM) are believed to help
   improve the software development process, the deployment of SDMs often
   encounters developers' resistance. Agile methodologies, the latest batch
   of SDMs that are better in dealing with volatile business requirements,
   are likely to face the same problems since they require developers to
   drastically change their work habits and acquire new skills. Therefore,
   it is essential to identify the factors that could potentially influence
   individual developer's acceptance of agile methodologies. This paper
   reviews the literature on the acceptance of SDMs and agile
   methodologies, which serves to assess current understanding in the
   acceptance of SDMs and agile methodologies. From this review, we
   identify a set of potential factors and develop a framework to guide
   future research in individual acceptance of agile methodologies.},

Abstract = {An attempt to control and standardize new application software
   development has led a large telecommunications firm in the Southwest
   United States to create a centralized Information Technology department.
   Centralization, however, resulted in an increase in development and

   costs, especially for small and medium-sized IT projects. Functional
   units within the firm, faced with uncertain and fast-changing business
   environments, responded to the increased development and implementation
   times by creating their own development teams, thus competing with the
   centralized department and thwarting the synergies realized from having
   a centralized IT department.
   Alternative development processes to the waterfall process currently in
   use by the firm were studied. Of the alternative processes, Extreme
   Programming was selected to be deployed in a phased approach. This paper
   examines the issues facing the company, the alternative software
   development processes considered, and the selection criteria. The paper

Abstract = {Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an emerging architectural style
   for developing and integrating enterprise applications. Businesses are
   required to be agile and flexible and IT managers are being asked to
   deliver improved functionality while leveraging existing IT investment.
   Globalisation, tighter economies, business process outsourcing and ever
   increasing regulatory environments are forcing the large enterprises to
   transform the way they provide their business and services. In this
   context, SOA promises better alignment of IT with business, seamless
   integration of business functions and reduced costs of development and
   the industry is keen to embrace this new architectural style. Realising
   the opportunity, major enterprise software vendors have released a
   number of development tools. However, a majority of these are difficult
   to use and do not deliver the benefits they claim. In this paper, we
   introduce the SOA approach, present the benefits it offers, discuss some
   of the frameworks, tools and products offered by major software vendors
   and provide general guidance for building and implementing SOA. The
   objective is to provide enough background information that enterprises
   wishing to embark on the road to SOA have a better understanding.},

Abstract = {Object-oriented software design is a kind of black-art that requires a
   combination of common sense, experience, good taste and the capability
   to look at a problem from different points of view. According to our
   experience, these abilities cannot be easily transferred to the students
   in a lecture. Taking ideas from the way software is designed in
   industry, according to agile methodologies, we have tried a more active
   teaching approach using role-play. Students are faced with a design
   problem and provided with an initial sketchy design, i.e. a number of
   classes, and several use cases to be solved using those classes. Each
   student adopts the role of an object and each use case is executed
   through message passing between the objects represented by the students.
   This way, the students have the chance to, at their own pace, evaluate
   the consequences of a given design and test their ideas with the other
   actors in play. The good results obtained during the empirical
   evaluation of this active learning approach have motivated us to
   transfer our teaching methodology to virtual environments. Using our
   previous experience developing game-based learning environments and
   taking ingredients from the interface and gameplay of first-person
   shooters and sport games, we have designed a role-play virtual
   environment (RPVE) that intends to maintain, and even reinforce, the
   benefits of role-play in the classroom. We developed ViRPlay3D, a RPVE
   to understand object-oriented software behavior. It supported a single
   player, included a simple metaphor and did not allow the modification of
   CRC cards. Nowadays, we have completed the specifications of ViRPlay3D2,
   an extension of ViRPlay3D for, both, understanding and creating
   object-oriented designs. ViRPlay3D2 is a multiplayer environment where
   students mimic the classroom role-play sessions. The students are
   immersed in the environment using a first-person view that simulates the
   point of view of the objects that participate in the role-play. The
   students can modify the proposed design and the simulation is recorded
   for a further evaluation.},

Abstract = {Agile Software development has become to be one of the most prominent
   approaches in the field of software engineering. The amount of empirical
   evidence is quickly building up and it is known that already one out of
   seven software companies use agile processes. Many of the major
   corporations have announced to pursue for agile solutions with the aim
   of improving dramatically the lead-times, costs and quality aspects.
   Little is still known about the theoretical underpinnings of agile
   approaches. This tutorial serves for two purposes. First it demonstrates
   how agile solutions are theoretically founded and then in very pragmatic
   terms shows a longitudinal four-year case study how F-Secure, an

Abstract = {As the Army transforms into a more lethal, lighter and agile force, the
   technologies that support these systems must decrease in size while
   increasing in intelligence. Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) are
   one such technology that the Army and Department of Defense will rely on
   heavily to achieve these objectives. Current and future military
   applications of MEMS devices include safety and arming devices, fuzing
   devices, various guidance systems, sensors/detectors, inertial
   measurement units, tracking devices, radio frequency devices, wireless
   RFIDs and network systems, GPSs, radar systems, mobile base systems,
   satellites, missiles and the like.
   The MEMS devices. may be required to last as long as the lifetime of the
   weapon systems in which they are embedded which may be decades. MEMS
   devices may also be required to function properly after extended periods
   of inactivity while in storage. Despite the increasing reliance on MEMS
   devices, there have been limited studies performed to determine their
   reliability and failure mechanisms. Accordingly, the US Army Corrosion
   Office at Picatinny, NJ manages the MEMS Reliability Assessment Program
   to address this issue.
   The goals of the MEMS Reliability Assessment Program are to: 1)
   establish the reliability of MEMS devices including the impact of
   transportation, long term storage, operating environment, and packaging
   \& interconnection issues, 2) analyze the compatibility of MEMS devices
   with energetic and other reactive materials that may be found in
   military items, 3) identify failure mechanisms and failure rates, 4)
   develop accelerated test protocols for assessing the reliability of
   MEMS, 5) develop reliability models for these devices, 6) identify a
   standardizing body, standard terminology, definitions, and categories
   for MEMS devices, and 7) determine potential test methodologies for
   assessing these mechanisms.
   Current ongoing efforts in support of the program include: 1) an
   assessment of the impacts of long-term storage as well as development of
   test standards and requirements, 2) initiation of Environmental Stress
   Screening (ESS) testing for the identification of failure mechanisms of
   selected devices, 3) drafting of a joint test protocol for assessment of
   the corrosion potential of MEMS devices, 4) assessment of applicability
   of reliability software packages for use with MEMS devices and 5)
   development of test guidelines and test capabilities for the assessment
   of MEMs reliability.
   Recent accomplishments of the program include an assessment of the MEMS
   \& NEMS technologies currently of interest to the DOD, Test Guidelines
   for Environmental Stress Screening (ESS) of MEMS devices and components,
   Long-Term Storage Test Guidelines, Assessment of the Barriers to
   Implementation, and other tools and methodologies to facilitate the
   transition of MEMS \& NEMS to the Department of Defense.
   The tools and capabilities generated under this program will benefit the
   MEMS user community by filling the information gap that currently exists
   for reliability. This will facilitate transition of this technology into
   weapon systems. With the rapid growth of the MEMS industry, it is
   crucial to consider the reliability of this emerging technology and its
   applications in the early stages of development.},

Abstract = {RUP is a comprehensive software development process framework that has
   gained a lot of interest by the industry. One major challenge of taking
   RUP into use is to tailor it to specific needs and then to introduce it
   into a development organization. This study presents a review and a
   systematic assembly of existing studies on the tailoring and
   introduction of RUP. From a systematic search for study reports on this
   topic we found that most research is anecdotal and focus on the effects
   of RUP itself. Only a few number of studies address tailoring and
   introduction. We have found that tailoring RUP is a considerable
   challenge by itself and that it must be closely related to existing best
   practices. We see a tendency of turning from large complete process
   frameworks towards smaller and more light-weight processes which may
   impose a smoother transition from process model to process in use.},

Abstract = {Agile Methods have become a hot-spot in contemporary research and
   practice on software engineering. There are numerous successful and
   classic cases for applying agile methods. However software processes
   must adapt to the characteristics of projects, people and organizations.
   Since each software project is unique, we can hardly define a series of
   universal and repeatable processes for all agile projects. A pattern is
   a general solution to a common problem or issue, one from which a
   specific solution may be derived. This paper introduces concept of
   pattern into software process and organizes experience proved to be
   effective in agile methods as a group of patterns. Based on this group
   of process patterns, we propose a Process Pattern Language PPL for Agile
   Methods. Any agile project can find a series of process patterns from
   PPL according to its characteristics, and generate an appropriate
   process by following instructions from these patterns. We also give an
   example of applying this pattern language to generate software
   processes.},

Abstract = {The tea baking process is usually controlled by experience. It may leads
   to the instability of product quality. A new process control scheme for
   tea baking is proposed in this paper. Varied intelligent meters and
   concentrative controllers are used to construct the control system. A
   mathematic model is built to simplify the various factors, such as
   growth zone, breed, tea picking season, baking temperature, surrounding
   humidity, moisture of tea leaves, and consumer's desire. Furthermore, a
   novel interface software is designed to make the communication between
   controller and intelligent meters more agile, stable, and extensible.
   The proposed controlling scheme has been adopted by tea manufactories,
   and the result shows that the process control is effective and feasible,
   and the quality of tea is greatly improved.},

Abstract = {In the IT industry, software maintenance after system delivery is a
   major concern for any system development team. Software maintenance
   involves system updates for new customer requirements and error
   corrections within the delivered software. The management of maintenance
   is the service management of IT products, the cost of which can account
   for more than 50\% of the total development budget. A major reason for
   the high cost is the changes brought about by the software updates and
   error corrections. Inconsistencies in the changes occurring in software
   development and service management afterwards cause confusion and
   misunderstanding, leading to further difficulties of maintenance, which
   enevitably result in further cost increases. To keep the consistency of
   software products and improve the service management in IT software
   products, software configuration management(SCM) is an approach. Here, a
   conceptual framework is set up to introduce relationships between the
   four areas of SCM and implement mandatory referential integrity between
   them within the software development stages, then maintain these
   enforced relationships between stages. It can set up rules to ensure
   mandatory integrity in changes, retaining consistency and improving
   Service Management. It is flexible enough to apply with any development
   models, waterfall, rapid prototyping, spiral development, etc.},

Abstract = {On the surface, Model-Driven Architecture(MDA) appears to be a
   fundamentally new paradigm compared to traditional software development.
   Upon closer examination, however MDA mainly shifts the focus of
   iterative development to a higher level of abstraction. The traditional
   waterfall software development process (and its variations) dictates
   that the system development be driven by low-level design and coding.
   This can introduce many productivity, maintenance and documentation
   issues into the process. Using the MDA pushes development to a higher
   level, where platform-independent analysis and detailed
   platform-specific design modeling make it easier to trace back to the
   requirements, thereby introducing a more stringent governance over the
   project. Also, it introduces a technology and platform independent
   standardized development process, system interoperability internally as
   well as the ability to provide communication bridges with external
   systems. The systems can be portable, which allows for what the creators
   of the MDA, the Object Management Group (OMG), refer to as ``future
   proofing{''} of software systems. This is the ability to have long-lived
   models that can be applied to any new implementation technologies that
   will ultimately be created and introduced to the software development
   world. This paper seeks to introduce and demystify MDA concepts and
   features, and show how their application can be used to develop highly
   interoperable and robust medical device software systems. In particular
   if medical devices are designed using the MDA approach, they can quickly
   be adapted to utilize any interoperability (or ``plug and play{''})
   standard that evolves in the future.},

Abstract = {Development of mobile software is Surrounded by much uncertainty.
   Immature software platforms on mobile clients, a highly competitive
   market calling for innovation, efficiency and effectiveness in the
   development life cycle, and lacking end-user adoption are just some of
   the realities facing development teams in the mobile software industry.
   By taking a process view on development of mobile systems we seek to
   explore the strengths and limitations of eXtreme Programming (XP) in the
   context of mobile software development. Following an experimental
   approach a mobile systems development project running for four months is
   conducted. Experiences from the project are used for analysis and
   discussion of the fit of XP in mobile systems development. First,
   requirements for mobile systems development projects are proposed.
   Second, these are analysed and compared to the prescribed principles
   suggested in XP.
   In general, we find XP well-suited for mobile systems development
   projects. However, based on our experiences and an analytical comparison
   we propose the following modifications to XP: Make an essential design
   to avoid the worst time waste during refactoring. For faster
   development, reuse code components whenever possible. Test regularly oil
   real devices, since the difference between emulators and real devices
   are significant. Take advantage of spikes. Do not use pair programming
   when spiking, and remember to write unit tests for production code that
   was initially created during spikes. Monitor the user during acceptance
   tests.},

Abstract = {Development of the telecommunications software systems is a highly

Abstract = {Agile processes have been introduced to avoid the problems most of
   software practitioners have run up against by using traditional software
   development methodologies. These are well known for their benefits like
   focus on quality, early business value delivery, higher morale of
   stakeholders, and the reduced cost/schedule. Also, they can support the
   earlier and quicker production of the code by dividing the product into
   small segments called iterations. However, there are on-going debates
   about their flexibility to accommodate changing requirements and whether
   the productivity and quality of the agile processes is satisfactory for
   the customers or not. Previously available studies have mostly focused
   on comparing XP(eXtreme Programming) with some other Agile
   methodologies, rather than comparing it with traditional plan-driven
   software development methodologies. In this Paper, we identify the XP
   phases and practices, how they ensure product quality, and map XP phases
   against the Spiral model phases to prove that XP has built-in QA(Quality
   Assurance) practices in its life cycle, in addition to its focus on
   productivity. A case study is also included to empirically investigate
   quality of the product developed using XP with comparison to the product

Abstract = {Enterprise2.0 is the use of emergent social software tools to improve
   knowledge sharing and collaboration within and between firms, their
   customers and partners. This paper proposes that Enterprise2.0 is a
   double-edged sword and should be adopted cautiously. Emerging trends in
   e-business are specialisation and collaboration, creating a diverse
   population of organisations, each tightly defined by its core
   competences, interacting in a constant sequence of transient
   relationships, each motivated by a particular market opportunity. These
   dynamic business networks depend on the establishment of appropriate
   platforms and global standards to enable smooth interaction between the
   service components, in particular, appropriate metadata such as
   ontologies. The dynamism of such an interconnected yet free-wheeling
   economy is constrained unless risks relating to investment in a new
   business relationship are reduced to levels where the risk-reward ratio
   favours agility rather than inertia. For its advocates, Enterprise2.0
   techniques promise to contribute to the evolution of dynamic, agile,
   collaborative e-commerce. However, its egalitarian and permissive nature
   creates challenges. Folksonomies allow a more customer-centric view of
   an organisation's value proposition but may also undermine carefully
   devised official ontologies. Collaborative filtering may provide a
   mechanism for mitigating risk but the trust created is dependent upon
   the perceived credibility of the reviewers. A high profile example of an
   initiative designed to facilitate dynamic e-commerce which failed due to
   unsatisfactory classification of its members and the perceived risk of
   interacting with unknown reputations is examined. Recent academic
   research and practical applications that address these conflicts are
   reviewed.},

Abstract = {New Advances in mobile computer technology and the rapid growth of
   wireless networks in quality and quantity has introduced new
   applications and concerns in computer science and industry. The unique
   requirements and constraints associated with mobile systems have brought
   new challenges to software development for such environments, as it
   demands extensive improvements to traditional systems development
   methodologies in order to fulfill the special needs of this field.
   We examine the challenges of developing software for mobile systems,
   starting by reviewing mobile systems' characteristics and invesgating
   the status quo of mobile software development methods. It has been shown
   that Agile methodologies are appropriate methods for the development of
   such systems; based on this assumption, we identify specific
   requirements for a mobile software development methodology, based on
   which a new agile method is engineered using the Hybrid Methodology
   Design approach. We claim that this methodology, and the approach used
   for its construction, can facilitate the application of software
   engineering approach to the production of mobile software systems.},

Abstract = {One of the problems associated with complex systems engineering is
   identifying the system knowledge relevant to build system
   implementation. System operations are an essential part of this
   knowledge. Software and system engineering standards highlight the
   importance of system operations; templates for a concept of operations
   document are available from different standard bodies in the context of
   requirements engineering and specification. However, specific guidelines
   for operations modeling are not usually provided.
   This paper introduces an approach to systematically model system
   operations. The cornerstone for this is an operations metamodel; this
   metamodel is presented within this paper and has been defined using UML
   2.x. The baseline for the metamodel is a schema, also introduced within
   the paper, which formalizes system operations in terms of commands
   acting on systems, inputs to the system, and different kinds of outputs
   classified into responses, notifications and alarms. Operations models,
   as presented here, comprise system knowledge essentials from a
   functional point of view but reduced in size compared to the whole
   system specification. They can be deployed in several ways; this paper
   presents their use as drivers for system development and validation from
   early lifecycle stages.},

Abstract = {Refactoring has been growing in importance with recent software
   engineering approaches, particularly agile methodologies, which promote
   continuous improvement of an application's code and design. Web
   applications are especially suitable for refactoring because of their
   rapid development and continuous evolution. Refactoring is about
   applying transformations that preserve program behavior. Code
   refactorings apply transformations to the source code while model
   refactorings apply to design models, both with the purpose of increasing
   internal qualities like maintainability and extensibility. In this paper
   we propose Web model refactorings as transformations that apply to the
   design models of a Web application. Particularly, we define refactorings
   on the navigation and presentation models, and present examples. Since
   changing these models,impacts on what the user perceives, the intent of
   Web model refactorings is to improve external qualities like usability.
   They may also help to introduce Web patterns in a Web application.},

Abstract = {For modern systems there is growing proof that serial/traditional
   approaches, such as the traditional waterfall model and model driven
   architecture, are ineffective and development lifecycles need to be
   iterative and incremental. In this presentation, we discuss the
   iterative and incremental approach for software design methodology
   called Test Driven Design (TDD). The TDD Development Cycle starts with
   the requirement specification and therefore captures defects much
   earlier in the development cycle. TDD requires that no production code
   be written until first a unit test is written. We compare TDD with the
   traditional methods and describe in detail the TDD method. We cover
   continuous integration, acceptance testing, system wide testing for each
   iteration, test frameworks, cost of change, ROI, benefits and
   limitations of the new Test Driven Design and provide evidence from
   industry that TDD leads to higher programmer productivity with higher
   code quality. The future work investigations will extend the reach and
   effectiveness of TDD by using latest technologies to generate tests from
   message sequence charts and generating code thru use of a Model Compiler
   leading to an Advanced Test Driven Design methodology. Further
   investigations will also look at the concurrency issues by use of LTSA

Title = {An empirical ground-motion attenuation relation for inelastic spectral

Volume = {96},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This article presents an empirical ground-motion prediction model
   (attenuation relation) for inelastic (as opposed to elastic) spectral
   displacement (S-di) for ground motions without forward directivity
   effects. It is a function of two earthquake parameters, moment magnitude
   (M-w) and the closest distance to rupture (R-rup), and two bilinear
   oscillator parameters, an undamped elastic period (T) and a yield
   displacement (d(y)). The d(y) is introduced via the predicted median
   strength-reduction factor ((R) over cap), a proxy for the ratio of
   elastic spectral displacement (S-de) to d(y), which is identical with
   the familiar strength-reduction factor (R). The proxy recognizes that
   (R) over cap can only be estimated indirectly because it implicitly
   contains the random variable, S-de, which cannot be known a priori;
   therefore, the median estimate or predicted median ((S) over cap (de))
   from a conventional (elastic) ground-motion prediction model is used
   instead to calculate (R) over cap = (S) over cap (de)/d(y). For enhanced
   generality, the inelastic spectral displacement prediction model here is
   based on a ratio concept, that is, the total model is a (any)
   conventional elastic prediction model coupled with a new inelastic
   displacement ratio prediction model, with proper statistical correlation
   between the two. We empirically consider the dependence of this ratio on
   source and path effects (i.e., M-w and R-rup), and find that M-w is
   significant, but R-rup is not. The resulting prediction model can easily
   be added to existing probabilistic seismic-hazard analysis (PSHA)
   software packages with only one extra structure-specific parameter, dy
   of the oscillator. In practical engineering applications, this will
   likely have been estimated from the conventional static pushover
   analysis of the multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) structure under
   consideration.
   The resulting PSHA product is a hazard curve for S-di, the inelastic
   spectral displacement of a nonlinear oscillator. Such a curve can
   provide a more direct hazard-based target displacement for nonlinear
   static procedures (Federal Emergency Management Agency {[}FEMA] 356,
   2000) and/or a basic input function for new probabilistic seismic-demand
   analyses that is based on S-di (as opposed to S-de) as an efficient and
   sufficient intensity measure. This new attenuation relationship will be
   particularly useful in evaluating the performance of existing structures
   and specified designs with known lateral strength. In particular, unlike
   most past studies, it does not pre-fix the ductility level.},

Abstract = {Software development can be seen as a process of knowledge acquisition,
   in which human beings progressively learn about the intended behavior of
   the desired systems. Thereby, development is subject to considerable
   amounts of uncertainty and variability, that make it impossible to
   proceed in a purely incremental fashion - at some points, the need
   always arises to reconsider part of the accumulated knowledge. With this
   problem in mind, agile development methodologies have been gaining
   popularity in recent years as a means to enhance productivity, and there
   have been attempts to supplement them with formal techniques for better
   reliability. However, the existing approaches to agile formal methods
   have practically limited themselves to adopting recommended practices of
   agile development, with no particular contribution from the employed
   formalisms. Compared to that, this paper advocates the use of formalisms
   intended for evolutionary development, with a two-fold objective: first,
   to exploit the knowledge acquired up to any given stage as a means to
   cope with frequent and numerous changes; and, second, to introduce
   support for the creative development tasks through an interactive
   procedure that helps taking steps forward.},

Abstract = {A variety of life cycle models for software development are generally
   available. Many of the variations were composed to overcome problems in
   the classic waterfall model. However, it is generally difficult to
   compare and contrast the methods and very little literature is available
   to guide developers and managers in making choices. Moreover, in order
   to make informed decisions, developers require access to real data that
   compares the different models and the results associated with the
   adoption of each model. An experiment in which 15 software teams
   developed comparable software products, using four different development
   approaches (V-model, incremental model, evolutionary model, and extreme

Abstract = {Background: Agile is an iterative approach to software development that
   relies on strong collaboration and automation to keep pace with dynamic
   environments. We have successfully used agile development approaches to
   create and maintain biomedical software, including software for
   bioinformatics. This paper reports on a qualitative study of our
   experiences using these methods.
   Results: We have found that agile methods are well suited to the
   exploratory and iterative nature of scientific inquiry. They provide a
   robust framework for reproducing scientific results and for developing
   clinical support systems. The agile development approach also provides a
   model for collaboration between software engineers and researchers. We
   present our experience using agile methodologies in projects at six
   different biomedical software development organizations. The
   organizations include academic, commercial and government development
   teams, and included both bioinformatics and clinical support
   applications. We found that agile practices were a match for the needs
   of our biomedical projects and contributed to the success of our
   organizations.
   Conclusion: We found that the agile development approach was a good fit
   for our organizations, and that these practices should be applicable and
   valuable to other biomedical software development efforts. Although we
   found differences in how agile methods were used, we were also able to
   identify a set of core practices that were common to all of the groups,
   and that could be a focus for others seeking to adopt these methods.},

Abstract = {It is time for a change in mindset in how nurses operationalize system
   implementations and manage projects. Computers and systems have evolved
   over time from unwieldy mysterious machines of the past to ubiquitous
   computer use in every aspect of daily lives and work sites. Yet,
   disconcertingly, the process used to implement these systems has not
   evolved. Technology implementation does not need to be a struggle. It is
   time to adapt traditional plan-driven implementation methods to
   incorporate agile techniques. Agility is a concept borrowed from
   software development and is presented here because it encourages
   flexibility, adaptation, and continuous learning as part of the
   implementation process. Agility values communication and harnesses
   change to an advantage, which facilitates the natural evolution of an
   adaptable implementation process. Specific examples of agility in an
   implementation are described, and plan-driven implementation stages are
   adapted to incorporate relevant agile techniques. This comparison
   demonstrates how an agile approach enhances traditional implementation
   techniques to meet the demands of today's complex healthcare
   environments.},

   Research has shown that although group estimation in many cases is

   For instance, group estimation performance can be reduced by dominant
   personalities and anchoring effects. Through the analysis of 101 user
   story estimates, made by an XP team for release planning, we investigate
   whether the introduction of the planning poker estimation process
   improved the estimation ability of the team. The results show that
   planning poker improved the team's estimation performance in most cases,
   but that it increased estimation error in the extreme cases.},

Abstract = {For the agile software development community, agility is defined by the
   values expressed in the agile manifesto. But in concrete terms, what
   does it mean for a software project to be agile? US Air Force Colonel
   John Boyd defined agility as the ability to operate the
   Observation-Orientation-Decision-Action (OODA) loop faster than an
   adversary. Agility therefore depends on the tempo at which we can
   exploit the OODA loop, and it is culture, not methodologies or tools
   that determine our OODA loop speed. This definition of agility has
   implications for the software development community. This short paper
   introduces Colonel Boyd, the OODA loop, the factors which influence OODA
   loop speed and the possible research opportunities into software
   engineering culture we are considering.},

Abstract = {Ever in search of a silver bullet for automated functional testing for
   Web Applications, many folks have turned to Selenium. Selenium is an
   open-source project for in-browser testing, originally developed by
   ThoughtWorks and now boasting an active community of developers and
   users. One of Selenium's stated goals is to become the de facto
   open-source replacement for proprietary tools such as WinRunner. Of
   particular interest to the agile community is that it offers the
   possibility of test-first design of web applications, red-green signals
   for customer acceptance tests, and an automated regression test bed for
   the web tier.
   This experience report describes the standard environment for testing
   with Selenium, as well as modifications we performed to incorporate our
   script pages into a wiki. It includes lessons we learned about
   continuous integration, script writing, and using the Selenium Recorder
   (renamed IDE). We also discuss how long it took to write and maintain
   the scripts in the iterative development environment, how close we came
   to covering all of the functional requirements with tests, how often the
   tests should be (and were) run, and whether additional automated
   functional testing below the GUI layer was still necessary and/or
   appropriate.
   While no silver bullet, Selenium has become a valuable addition to our
   agile testing toolkit, and is used on the majority of our web
   application projects. It promises to become even more valuable as it
   gains widespread adoption and continues to be actively developed.},

Abstract = {The Rational Unified Process (RUP) is a development process which is
   based on object-oriented, usecase-centric, architecture-centric, and
   iterative approaches. Most projects for public organizations have
   adopted waterfall model in software development lifecycle, however,
   various projects have recently tried to apply an iterative model to
   minimize risks and to enhance quality of software. But empirical results
   of software-intensive development based on the RUP are not well known.
   Therefore, this paper presents process, period, effort and quality
   factors for a software-intensive system development through the study on
   the Korean Core Instrumentation System (K-CIS) which has adopted the
   RUP. We also present the result of comparison between the K-CIS RUP and
   waterfall model, and lessons learned from the K-CIS case. We believe
   that our result is useful for establishment of a process and estimation
   of resource and quality factors for software-intensive systems
   efficiently.},

Abstract = {Modem software development methods such as Extreme Programming (XP)
   favor the use of frequently repeated tests, so-called regression tests,
   to catch new errors when software is updated or tuned, by checking that
   the software still produces the right results for a reference input.
   Regression testing is also very valuable for Extract-Transform-Load
   (ETL) software, as ETL software tends to be very complex and
   error-prone. However, regression testing of ETL software is currently
   cumbersome and requires large manual efforts. In this paper, we describe
   a novel, easy-to-use, and efficient semi-automatic test framework for
   regression test of ETL software. By automatically analyzing the schema,
   the tool detects how tables are related, and uses this knowledge, along
   with optional user specifications, to determine exactly What data
   warehouse (DW) data should be identical across test ETL runs, leaving
   out change-prone values such as surrogate keys. The framework also
   provides tools for quickly detecting and displaying differences between
   the current ETL results and the reference results. In summary, manual
   work for test setup is reduced to a minimum, while still ensuring an
   efficient testing procedure.},

   non-programming perspective, where by non-programming we mainly mean
   modeling. Instead of talking about Extreme Programming, we will
   introduce a Extreme Non-Programming (Extreme Modeling-Oriented)
   approach. We will base our ideas on the intensive work done during the
   last years, oriented to the objective of generating code from a
   higher-level system specification, normally represented as a Conceptual
   Schema. Nowadays, though, the hip around MDA has given a new push to
   these strategies. New methods propose sound model transformations which
   cover all the different steps of a sound software production process
   from an Information Systems Engineering point of view. This must include
   Organizational Modeling, Requirements Engineering, Conceptual Modeling
   and Model-Based Code Generation techniques. In this context, it seems

   top-down software development lifecycles are impractical. Software
   architects and designers will require agile, lightweight processes to
   evaluate tradeoffs in system design based on the ``estimated{''}
   responsiveness of external services coupled with known performance of
   local services. We introduce a model-driven software engineering
   approach for designing systems (i.e. workflows of web services) under
   these circumstances and a corresponding simulation-based evaluation
   tool.},

Abstract = {After a short introduction to the concepts of knowware, knowware
   engineering and knowledge middleware, this paper proposes to study the
   software/knowware co-engineering. Different from the traditional
   software engineering process, it is a mixed process involving both
   software engineering and knowware engineering issues. The technical
   subtleties of such a mixed process are discussed and guidelines of
   building models for it are proposed. It involves three parallel lines of
   developing system components of different types-The. key issues of this
   process are how to guarantee the correctness and appropriateness of
   system composition and decomposition. The ladder principle, which is a
   modification of the waterfall model, and the tower principle, which is a
   modification of the fountain model, are proposed. We also studied the
   possibility of equipping the co-engineering process, with a formal
   semantics. ne core problem of establishing such a theory is to give a
   formal semantics to an open knowledge source. We have found a suitable
   tool for this purpose. That is the co-algebra. We also try to give a
   preliminary delineation of a co-algebraic semantics for a typical
   example of open knowledge source - the knowledge distributed on the
   World Wide Web.},

Abstract = {Since their introduction at around the turn of the millennium, agile
   methods have taken the software process research and practice by storm.
   However, despite their wide and ever-expanding acceptance, many of those
   methods have limitations in terms of the types of projecis they could
   support. In parallel, there is mounting evidence that creating a method
   that is optimum for every software project is unattainable and
   impractical, In this paper, we propose not the selection or the adoption
   of a single agile method but the adoption and diffusion of a well
   established and recognized method flamework in which an organizational
   methodology is constructed from method fragments using the concepts of
   method engineering. This paper briefly reports on a case study of
   introducing method engineering using the OPEN process framework to
   construct an agile method for a multi-national legal publishing company
   who realized the need for a flexible and customizable method for their
   many projects.},

   and programmers compete to earn maximum number of points. Teams earn
   points for delivering properly produced artifacts. Artifacts in the game
   correspond to software modules delivered to customer in real software

   function. Manual computing values of the functions performed by the
   programmers substitutes real programming. Rules of Extreme89 closely
   correspond to XP practices. The game has two releases while each release
   is build-up of two increments. Extreme89 with its atmosphere of the

   according to the background of programmers, as appropriate. Unlike the
   usual practice of eXtreme Programming, in which all production code must
   written in pairs, all-the-time pair programming, the proposed model
   encourages programmers to design code patterns of their own in pairs and
   then to use these patterns to build sub-modules solo. The report finds
   that the longer team members work alone, the more code patterns they
   develop for reuse later in pairs.},

Abstract = {The Unattended Ground Sensor (UGS) Community includes many programs
   slated to incorporate the JTRS Cluster 5 Transceiver into the baseline
   systems. However, due to a variety of technical challenges, it's unclear
   that the Cluster 5 Transceiver will be available in time to support
   requirements for near-term fieldings. As a result, program offices are
   beginning to investigate interim solutions for Software Defined Radios
   (SDR) capable of providing Cluster 5-like flexibility and performance.
   During the last 15 months, Nova Engineering has been developing the Core
   Transceiver, a unique multi-band, multi-rate, Software Defined Radio.
   The Core Transceiver operates in four bands (225-400 MHz, 560-698 MHz,
   1350-1390 MHz, and 1755-1850 MHz) and is frequency-agile across these
   multiple bands, thereby providing maximum flexibility in frequency
   planning. The transceiver supports adaptable data rates from 100 kbps to
   more than 1 Mbps, enabling the device to satisfy requirements for
   sensor-to-sensor communications, as well as gateway links. This
   transceiver utilizes an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex (OFDM)
   waveform for robust operation in ground-to-ground multipath
   environments. The Core Transceiver is compact in size (6.5 `' x 2.85 `'
   x 0.8 `') and designed for energy-constrained applications. This paper
   introduces the Core Transceiver requirements, design concept, and
   implementation, and outlines a strategy for applying this transceiver
   within the UGS Community.},

Abstract = {Test-driven development (TDD) is an agile software development strategy
   that addresses both design and testing. This paper describes a
   controlled experiment that examines the effects of TDD on internal
   software design quality. The experiment was conducted with undergraduate
   students in a software engineering course. Students in three groups
   completed semester-long programming projects using either an iterative
   Test-First (TDD), iterative Test-Last, or linear Test-Last approach.
   Results from this study indicate that TDD can be an effective software
   design approach improving both code-centric aspects such as object
   decomposition, test coverage, and external quality, and
   developer-centric aspects including productivity and confidence. In
   addition, iterative development approaches that include automated
   testing demonstrated benefits over a more traditional linear approach
   with manual tests. This study demonstrates the viability of teaching TDD
   with minimal effort in the context of a relatively traditional
   development approach. Potential dangers with TDD are identified
   regarding programmer motivation and discipline. Pedagogical implications
   and instructional techniques which may foster TDD adoption will also be
   referenced.},

Abstract = {To address the problems of traditional software development

   industry, there is a growing demand to expose Software Engineering
   students to agile development practices. This, however, is not a
   straightforward task as the corresponding practices cannot be adjusted
   easily to a learning environment or may even run counter to educational
   goals. In this paper we discuss our experiences in introducing agile
   practices in student software development projects and reflect on both
   the benefits and drawbacks of agile processes in this setting.},

Abstract = {For too long software has been produced using processes that result in a
   product that is completed late, over-budget, and below the quality
   expectations of end users. Over the last 25 years a great many
   incremental, evolutionary, and iterative software development process
   models have been introduced with the intention of improving software
   development; yet a recent study by the Standish Group reported that
   fewer than 28\% of software projects are completed on schedule within
   budget and with most of the originally required features. We believe
   that getting the requirements right is the key to building successful
   and reliable software products. In the requirements process the product
   features are defined, the users are identified, and the user
   interactions with the system are designed. In addition, usage profiles
   are developed and estimates of the anticipated software reliability
   based on those profiles and on formal models of the system are obtained.
   Thus, reliability becomes an integral part of the requirement
   development process rather than an after thought of testing at the end
   of the development process. Although, defining the requirements may be
   an iterative process, a complete and correct set of requirements must be
   completed before starting to build the product.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes an effective agile teaching environment with a new
   educational testing framework for especially Java programming courses.
   The testing framework is developed on top of JUnit that runs on the
   Eclipse platform. The deployed testing programs detect errors in the
   student's code, and then report points lost due to mistakes, and give
   suitable pieces of advice to correct or improve the code immediately.
   With automated testing the students can check the validity of their code
   by themselves. This means that the instructor can concentrate on
   mentoring the students who are most in need of support and advice. Our
   proposed method also ensures the evaluation of assignments to be fair
   and strict by applying various well-behaved input patterns based on
   standard software testing techniques while saving time. With our testing
   framework, students are continuously aware of their progress under a
   game-like environment, and thereby they keep concentrating on their
   given tasks.},

Abstract = {Most large IT organizations need the best of both worlds - working
   software that supports ever-changing business needs, and a process for
   delivering software that is predictable, trainable, and auditable.
   Organizations with agile software teams often receive timely,
   cost-effective solutions of sufficient quality. Organizations with
   formal processes often benefit from industry-recognized certifications
   and robust process improvement mechanisms. Rarely does a single, large
   IT organization achieve both.
   DTE Energy has such a combination: its lightweight yet CMMI-compatible
   methodology is now used within its 600+ person IT organization to
   deliver and support working software. Its, small teams embrace core
   agile principles as they provide `just enough `` solutions that satisfy
   maturing business needs. Yet they passed two SCAMPI appraisals toward
   formal CMMI Level III accreditation, scheduled for mid-2006
   This report extends the Agile 2005 experience report on DTE Energy's
   agile IT organization's journey toward CMMI staged maturity
   accreditation. This report briefly recaps their seven years of agile
   experience, presents governance mechanisms and change management
   techniques, and highlights their four-release, one-year plan for CMMI
   Level III accreditation. Finally, this report offers suggestions on
   embracing a formal process framework that are applicable to any
   organization.},

   agile practices on two projects at a major car rental company which,
   although sharing many similarities including staff, professed commitment
   to agile process, architecture, and programming environment, experienced
   two drastically different outcomes.
   The first became bogged down and eventually went to production late,
   over-budget, with fewer features then expected, and was only reluctantly
   embraced by its user community. The second was ready for its first
   production milestone after only 9 weeks, was enthusiastically embraced
   by its users, and went on to become an unqualified success and a model
   for other software development projects at this company. In this report
   I will illustrate the similarities between these two projects, highlight
   the differences, and draw conclusions about the factors critical to the
   success of agile projects in large corporate environments.},

Abstract = {When BT began to look at how you transform an organization of
   approximately 14,000 people to become an Agile organisation a key
   challenge faced was how to support this size of a transformation from a
   coaching perspective i.e. how do you leverage a relatively small finite
   coaching resource so that it can be effective.
   BT drew inspiration from the ``Law of Strawbeny Jam{''} and
   intentionally set out to build internal Agile coaching capability. Based
   on positive experience with ``Pair Coaching{''} an ``Apprentice
   Coaching{''} model was chosen as an effective approach for building this
   internal coaching capability. This provided a rich and experience based
   learning environment while also allowing the group to be effective as it
   engaged with the BT Exact organisation.},

Abstract = {Reed Elsevier implemented a ``learn by doing{''} strategy and a managed
   approach to enable a large organization in an agile development process.
   CEO support and the promise of the benefits the process would yield were
   critical success factors. Picking the right project, assembling a strong
   team, and partnering with experts were all key in delivering on the
   promise. The appointment of a dedicated person accountable for the
   successful enablement was essential. During the journey, important
   lessons were learned about integrating User-Centered Design, managing
   release plans, and working with other teams. In addition, a stage-gate
   governance model was overlaid on the agile development process. This not
   only gave the business the means to manage investment but also provided
   an effective avenue for familiarizing senior management with agile

   What barriers will I have to overcome? All of these are important

   way. To enable a good discussion, the language of that discussion must
   be established.
   As Medtronic adopted Agile, we realized how important it was to put
   effort into the language. We established a framework for that language,
   organizing our thoughts into, three areas: Principles, Practices, and
   Benefits. When talking with visionaries or evangelists, we speak in
   terms of principles to understand why Agile is the way it; is. With
   practitioners or pragmatists, we speak in terms Of Practices to
   understand how to do Agile. With skeptics, we speak in terms of benefits
   to determine whether Agile is a good thing for us. In most cases, an
   effective conversation needs to address all three perspectives. The
   framework and language help us determine whether issues are related
   simply to communication barriers, or are related to the decisions of
   whether and how to apply Agile to our world.},

   these Agile projects found themselves adapting to new team dynamics in
   ways that were quite agile, including creative time-slicing, scaling
   across multiple teams, and finding ways to save time while focusing on
   business value.
   We also found that, even though writers can be uncomfortable while
   adapting the documentation process to conform to Agile practices, they
   can rise to the challenges and assist their product teams in becoming
   more proficient and efficient in an Agile world. For writers to become
   truly agile, their management must invest in the tools, technologies,

Abstract = {When our team adopted Extreme Programming and Scrum, there were a number
   of challenges. Integrating an agile team in a ``traditional{''}
   organization created friction and conflict within the team and with
   management. The team consisted of volunteers new to agile practices. We
   had difficulties with planning, estimation, task breakdown, managing
   requirements and working together in a collocated space. However, the
   biggest challenge the team encountered was not in any of these other
   areas, but in one that most of the team figured was simple: Testing.
   This paper describes how difficult it was to actually get the various
   testing practices in place and functioning properly. In particular, I
   discuss challenges we faced in coming to a common understanding of the
   practices, estimating testing effort, allocating the time required to do
   automated tests in a feature-driven culture, and getting a team of
   diverse individuals to understand how to apply principles that sound
   great but are challenging to implement.},

   Formed in 1967, OCLC develops software for use by libraries and their
   users, museums, and academic institutions. Researchers, students,
   faculty, scholars, professional librarians and other information seekers
   use OCLC services to obtain bibliographic, abstract and full-text
   information. OCLC aims to be the leading global library cooperative.
   More than 54,000 libraries in 96 countries and territories around the
   world use OCLC services to locate, acquire, catalog, lend and preserve
   library materials.
   This paper examines how TCC, a training and consultancy company from
   Cheshire, England has worked with OCLC, the Online Computer Library
   Center based in Dublin, Ohio to incorporate the Dynamic Systems
   Development Method (DSDM) into a development culture that was
   deeply-rooted in ``traditional{''} software development methods.
   Examples from multiple projects illustrate how the adoption of DSDM
   helped OCLC change its culture and achieve success in software
   development and deployment. OCLC's TLC dashboard was used to track the
   effectiveness of the development cycle, and to collect metrics from 2003
   to the present. We discuss some of the challenges we faced and the six
   agile steps to success.},

Abstract = {The rapid expansion of the COTS domain causes a ``snowball{''} effect to
   the growth of information about and used by components. One of the
   proofed methods to organize information is taxonomies. Although there
   exist many upper and domain-specific taxonomies, the need to create or
   extend a taxonomy often arises. However, the effort needed for the
   construction of a successful COTS taxonomy could be an obstacle because
   it requires expertise and skills different to the ones needed for COTS
   development. This and many other problems can drive COTS developers to
   abandon the taxonomies. This paper proposes an agile approach for COTS
   taxonomies development based on our work in the MERCED project. The
   method introduces work separation and step-by-step development in the
   process of taxonomy construction. First the approach allows a quick
   start using a high-level taxonomy, created without spending too much
   effort for its development. Then, in parallel with taxonomy use, the
   approach allows its extension using dynamic decision models. These
   dynamic decision models simplify not only the taxonomy development, but
   also many other activities as quality control, documentation and
   configuration control. In this paper we also present a real-world
   example showing how the method operates within the domain of real-time
   embedded software components.},

Abstract = {Agile software development methods mainly aim at increasing software
   quality by fostering customer collaboration and performing exhaustive
   testing. The introduction of Extreme Programming (XP) - the most common
   agile software development method - into an organization is accompanied
   with conceptual and organizational changes. These changes range from
   daily-life changes (e.g., sitting together and maintaining an
   informative project environment) and continue with changes on the
   management level (e.g., meeting and listening to the customer during the
   whole process and the concept of the whole team which means that all
   role holders are part of the team). This paper examines the process of
   transition to an agile development process in a large-scale software
   project in the Israeli Air Force as it is perceived from the system
   analysis and design perspective. Specifically, the project
   specifications of the agile team are compared with those of a team who
   continues working according to the previous heavyweight method during
   the first half year of transition. Size and complexity measures are used
   as the basis of the comparison. In addition to the inspection of the
   specifications, the change in the role of the system analysts, as the
   system analysts conceive of it, is examined.},

   various contexts for UI should be adjusted automatically and
   immediately. In this paper, the UI design pattern (UIDP) is introduced
   into the adaptive UI design. The agile and flexible user interface is
   proposed according as the UIDP Library and intelligent agent. When the
   user performs normal interaction operations, the intelligent agent
   captures the various information contained the device information and
   user preferences to build the corresponding knowledge database.
   According as the UIDP recognized, the adaptive presentation searches the
   relative UIDP in UIDPs and executes the adjustment for UI automatically.
   Finally, the implementation and case are described for the system.},

Abstract = {At first glance, agile methods and global software development might

   problem of global software development. One challenge to solve is how to
   apply agile practices in settings where continuous face-to-face
   interaction is missing. However, agile methods have been successfully
   used in distributed projects, indicating that they could benefit global
   software development. This paper discusses potential benefits and
   challenges of adopting agile methods in global software development. The
   literature on real industrial case studies reporting on experiences of
   using agile methods in distributed projects is still scarce. Therefore
   we suggest further research on the topic. We present our plans for
   research in companies using agile methods in their distributed projects.
   We also intend to test the use of agile principles in globally
   distributed student projects developing software for industrial clients.},

Abstract = {Applied research is, by necessity, a distributed, collaborative process.
   To be useful, research methodologies must not only be applicable in such

   eXtreme Researching (XR), an adaptation of eXtreme Programming (XP) by
   Ericsson, to support distributed telecommunications research and
   development. XR builds on XP and tailors it to meet the needs of applied
   industrial research. It adopts and extends the most useful elements of
   XP: collective ownership, planning game, continuous integration and
   metaphor and shows how they are applicable in multi-site, research
   projects. XPWeb is developed as a tool to facilitate XR in a distributed
   research environment. XPWeb and XR are actively used by Ericsson Applied
   Research and have been shown to significantly increase output and

Abstract = {As software organisations mature, their repositories of reusable
   software components from previous projects will also grow considerably.
   Remaining conversant with all components in such a repository presents a
   significant challenge to developers. Indeed the retrieval of a
   particular component in this large search space may prove problematic.
   Further to this, the reuse of components developed in an Agile
   environment is likely to be hampered by the existence of little or no
   support materials. We propose to infer the need for a component and
   proactively recommend that component to the developer using a technique
   which is consistent with the principles of Agile methodologies. Our
   RASCAL recommender agent tracks usage histories of a group of developers
   to recommend to an individual developer components that are expected to
   be needed by that developer. Unlike many traditional recommender
   systems, we may recommend items that the developer has actually employed
   previously. We introduce a content-based filtering technique for
   ordering the set of recommended software components and present a
   comparative analysis of applying this technique to a number of
   collaborative filtering algorithms. We also investigate the relationship
   between the number of usage histories collected and recommendation
   accuracy. Our overall results indicate that RASCAL is a very promising
   tool for allowing developers discover reusable components at no
   additional cost.},

Abstract = {Telecommunications operators are undergoing massive transformations in
   order to metamorphose themselves into the ICT world and compete with

   major source of increased cost lies in the heavy integration tax we
   incur for integrating diverse systems implemented on diverse platforms
   and middleware, with heterogeneous data and process models. This paper
   looks at cost implications of lengthy and often manual migration
   to-and-from systems and platforms, and shows the clear business benefits
   of model-driven development (MDD) as defined by the Object Management
   Group (OMG). It is clearly demonstrated that model-driven development
   has matured into a practical, industrialised, scalable and evolvable

   light on documentation, and heavily automated through tooling. It
   enables management and organization of software engineering through use
   of agile metrics such as velocity and cumulative flow but with an added
   dimension of an understanding of variation - adapted from Deming's
   teachings. This is the story of how mixing Deming with Agile produced a
   lightweight CMMI solution for .Net developers everywhere.},

Abstract = {As distributed organizations increasingly rely, on technological
   innovations to enhance organizational efficiency and competitiveness,
   interest in agile environments that enhance the diffusion and adoption
   of innovations has grown. Although Information Systems has confirmed
   that social influence factors play an important role in the adoption of
   technological innovations by individuals, less is understood about the
   mechanisms within social communication networks that facilitate the flow
   of social influence and knowledge and about the organizational capacity
   to acquire and absorb new knowledge. This exploratory study helps to
   specify interactions and feedback within social communication networks
   and organizational capacities in a network organization environment. We
   use an exploratory case study, design to document how the flow of
   knowledge within social communication networks affected the adoption of
   a large-scale software system in several counties within New York state.
   Data from decision makers in two comparable network organizations were
   analyzed for differences in social communication networks and the
   organization's capability to absorb and exploit new knowledge. The data
   suggest that information system adoption was influenced by communication
   processes that reinforced social influences and supported knowledge
   transfer, and hampered when those processes were absent. Implications
   for the development of theory about the relationship between social
   information processing and the ability of an organization to absorb and
   adopt new technology are discussed.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the use of the agile methods, extreme
   programming (XP) and Serum, at the Intel Network Processor Division
   engineering team based in Shannon, Ireland, over a three-year-period The
   study is noteworthy as it is based on real industrial software projects
   involving experienced software engineers, with continuous reflection and
   monitoring of the application of these approaches. It provides evidence
   that agile methods are far from anti method; rather, they require
   disciplined application and careful customization to the particular
   needs of the development context. The study also shows how XP and Serum
   can complement each other to provide a comprehensive agile development
   method, with XP providing support for technical aspects and Serum
   providing support for project planning and tracking. The manner in which
   XP and Serum have been customized to suit the needs of the development
   environment at Intel Shannon is described, as are the lessons learned.
   The XP practices that were applied did lead to significant benefits,
   with pair-programming leading to reductions in code defect density, of a
   factor of seven, and one project actually achieving zero defect density
   However, some observed limitations of pair-programming are described.
   Intel Shannon also found that not all XP practices were applicable in
   their context. Thus. the study suggests that, contrary to suggestions
   that XP is not divisible or individually selectable, a la carte
   selection and tailoring of XP practices can work very well. In the case
   of Serum, some local customization has led to a very committed adoption
   by developers themselves, in contrast to many development methods whose
   use is decreed mandatory by management. The success of Scrum is
   significant. Projects of sLX-month and one-year duration have been
   delivered ahead of schedule, which bodes well for future ability to
   accurately plan development projects, a black art in software
   development up to now.},

   important benefits. This paper reports results of a case study where a
   mobile application was developed for global markets, using the TDD

Abstract = {Throughout the last three decades many processes, tools, and methods
   have been used to structure and bring some order into software
   development processes. One of the most widely understood traditional
   methods is the waterfall life cycle model. Recently, agile development
   methods have emerged to overcome some of the process and product-related
   problems associated with traditional models. They are believed to be
   lightweight, people focused, adaptive and allow knowledge transfer.
   Researchers in the area of knowledge management claimed that the
   knowledge creation process software developers build towards a specific
   mode will lead to its adoption. This paper attempts to integrate
   knowledge creation as a condition of adoption. This paper reports on how
   a Canadian organization shifts its development method from the waterfall
   process to Extreme Programming model. The findings show that the
   differences outweigh the similarities and caution needs to be exercised
   in adopting either one of two models. Knowledge creation, indeed, plays
   an important role in adopting Extreme Programming model. The
   implications of these findings for both researchers and practitioners
   are discussed.},

   2004. They began by outsourcing a small effort to an XP-proficient

   approach to gain acceptance. In retrospect, all parties involved now
   believe that the slow, gradual approach to XP adoption - building on

   regression test-sets do not provide the expected guarantees of
   correctness when applied to modified or extended objects. Such objects,
   which pass the saved tests, may yet contain introduced faults. This puts
   the whole practice of regression testing in XP into question. To obtain
   the same level of guarantee, tests must be regenerated from scratch for
   the extended object. A notion of guaranteed, repeatable quality after
   testing is defined.},

   with an overall increase in the complexity of the devices delivering

   can participate in, these systems require more than just the average
   approach to testing. The principles and practices of agile testing may
   serve development teams well here; since the systems ultimately end up
   being developed and deployed in an iterative and evolutionary manner. In
   this paper, we explore a testing framework for location-based services
   that can be employed test-first and yet also offers the full range of
   non-functional tests that these applications require.},

Abstract = {Genesys Solutions is a bespoke IT company, first of its kind, run by MSc
   and fourth year students of Department of Computer Science, University
   of Sheffield under the supervision of Prof. Mike Holcombe and Dr. Marian
   Gheorghe. Genesys follows the eXtreme Programming (XP) methodology for
   software development based on client requirements. The commitment
   towards XP and its `good software practices' can be considered as the
   greatest strength of Genesys.
   Agile Development Environment for Programming and Testing (ADEPT) is our
   contribution towards supporting the XP methodology by adopting the
   Eclipse platform along with its associated tools and frameworks within
   Genesys Solutions. It aimed to teach good software practices in Genesys
   to support XP by providing a software development life cycle management
   tool that will encompass the best practices of XP. It comprises of tools
   based on the principles of XP such as story cards, system metaphor,
   estimations, testing and quality assurance. ADEPT was the result of the
   IBM Eclipse Innovation 2004 awarded to the University of Sheffield.
   Also, based on the previous year's performance and more innovative ideas
   to implement more principles of XP we have been awarded another grant
   under the IBM Eclipse Innovation 2005 programme.},

Abstract = {Methodology adoption issues in the agile world are faced with challenges
   such as the growing trend towards the use of a group of relevant
   cross-methodology practices from the agile family as opposed to the
   adoption of individual methodologies. While this may see agile processes
   precipitating towards more mature software engineering processes, the
   challenge is that some of the specific agile methodologies may become
   extinct over time. This research therefore contributes a key addition to
   knowledge by developing a thinking tool that will guide system
   developers to informatively select agile practices from the entire agile
   methodologies family that are relevant to the project at hand. This
   paper proposes a novel modeling technique for tailoring methodologies to
   a particular environment using the family of methodologies approach. The
   Agile Methodologies Generic (AMG) model considers agile methodologies as
   a group of methodologies with common parameters that can be used to
   model the entire group. Based on this model, methodology parameters can
   be identified that are common among the different agile methodologies
   making it possible to create a set of relevant agile practices that can
   be used in an organization. The original concepts of the model are based
   on two foundations: 1) the philosophy of Jim Highsmith's Adaptive
   Software Development (ASD) methodology. ASD focuses on the speculate,
   collaborate and learn cycle iteratively which is fundamental to agile
   development, and 2) the concept of organizational maturity levels which
   says that mature organizations families of repeatable and automated
   processes. It is from such a perspective that AMG was born. AMG
   considers agile methodologies at an abstract level where the four values
   of the Agile Manifesto are assumed to collectively constitute basic
   philosophy of all agile methodologies. The phases of AMG (mechanistic,
   organic, and synergistic adaptation) are therefore analyzed in light of
   the values of the project at hand. The benefits of such a technology is
   the provision of a thinking tool that assists software development teams
   to effectively tailor agile methodologies to their project environments.
   The tool has been applied by two software development organisations and
   the results are being analysed.},

Abstract = {Scenario based notations axe becoming more and more popular as means for
   user requirements elicitation. They can be used in more formal
   specifications as part of detailed use case templates or in agile
   processes to capture informal user stories. Despite their significance
   in software engineering, scenarios seem not to be properly supported by
   appropriate tools. This paper describes a scenario construction tool
   that offers clear separation of the actual story from notions used
   therein. The tool is constructed as an extension to visual notation of
   UML's use cases. It is based on an extended UML metamodel in the area of
   activities and classifiers. This formal basis makes the tool capable of
   supplying the existing UML tools with an additional layer of
   requirements models based on scenarios and notions. This layer makes it
   possible to transform requirements directly into design-level models.
   The tool offers such transformation capabilities based on a simple model
   mapping. This transformation supports human efforts to keep the system's
   design consistent with the user's needs expressed through scenarios.},

Abstract = {Currently, software development organizations are increasingly
   interested in adopting agile processes and practices. The organizations,
   however, need procedures and methods for supporting a systematic
   selection and deployment of new agile practices and for tailoring them
   to suit the organizational context. In this paper, an agile deployment
   framework is proposed. It is compatible with the ideology of continuous
   improvement of organizational practices (QIP), while it also integrates
   it with the opportunities provided by short iterations of agile process
   model. The suggested framework includes the procedures and methods
   needed for selecting suitable new agile practices in an organization. It
   also embodies the means for iteratively tailoring and validating the
   deployed practices within agile projects and gaining feedback rapidly
   from projects to the organization. The paper presents the empirical
   experiences of a case study where the F-Secure Corporation deployed a
   new agile software development process (Mobile-D) in a pilot project in
   order to utilize its experiences in developing an organization specific

Abstract = {The Rational Unified Process (RUP) is a comprehensive software
   development process framework emphasizing use-cases, architecture focus
   and an iterative approach. RUP is widely known and many organizations

   be tailored to the specific context of use, no software development
   project is alike. This paper presents a case study of a Norwegian SME
   that tried to adopt RUP in the simplest way, by introducing the
   methodology by providing comprehensive documentation and some simple
   training. Our study shows that the use of RUP had some positive effects
   but also that the use has been scattered. Interviews with users of RUP
   show that there is a great need of better training and practical support
   in getting most value out of RUP. The key message is that if you
   consider taking RUP into use you have to invest resources in it.
   Training and support are key success factors.},

   Inexperienced teams unfamiliar with XP can face difficulties in adopting

   strategy. Intuitively, a step-by-step approach might seem more
   practical; however, XP practices are heavily intertwined and mutually
   dependent, creating problems in terms of prioritizing and justifying one
   instructional sequence over another. We propose a way to technically
   analyze the complex interrelationships between XP practices by
   identifying cluster patterns. These patterns can then be used to assist
   us in sequencing the introduction XP practices, helping both
   inexperienced teams and classroom learners in using XP. This work has
   value in both industrial and educational contexts.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses connections between a national culture and the
   culture inspired by software development methods (SDMs). Specifically,
   based on our research on cultural issues related to software development
   teams, we propose a model that can help predict whether a specific SDM
   fits a specific national culture. This model first defines the terms
   `tightness of an SDM' and `tightness of a national culture'. With
   respect to an SDM, this term articulates the idea that the tighter an
   SDM is, the more ordered the software development process and
   environment it inspires will be; with respect to a national culture, the
   term `tightness' reflects the degree to which a culture accepts and
   adopts ordered, planned and procedural work habits. The model then goes
   on to outline means that can help in the mapping of a given SDM, as well
   as a given national culture, along the following five dimensions:
   Project plan, procedures and standards, responsibility, time estimation,
   and individual need satisfaction. Finally, based on these mappings, the
   fitness of a given SDM and a national culture is examined. It is
   proposed that this fitness can serve as a tool for predicting the degree
   to which a given SDM will be accepted by a specific national culture in
   general, and by a specific team that is part of that culture, in
   particular. The model is illustrated using the Israeli hi-tech industry
   as an example of a national culture and Extreme Programming (XP) as an
   example of an SDM.},

Abstract = {When Primavera Systems decided to adopt agile methodologies for the
   development of their Project management suite, no one expected it to be
   easy. One part of the suite is a desktop solution with about 1.5 M lines
   of code in Delphi comprised of several applications. The other part is a
   set of web enabled applications using J2EE and Java. The development has
   tight release cycles and a high demand from marketing for new features.
   This paper describes from a software-architecture perspective, the
   transformation of a largely waterfall-based development strategy into an
   agile, test-driven practice. It looks at the obstacles and difficulties
   we faced during this change in the context of the desktop application

Abstract = {In this paper we examine the challenges of moving a large, traditionally
   waterfall-driven organization toward an agile development methodology.
   In particular we address the problems/successes we encountered in our
   attempts to adhere to the 12 practices of Extreme Programming given: 1)
   this was a first attempt with Agile techniques and in particular extreme
   programming and 2) an organization that while supportive, is still
   driven by its own set of governance processes which seem to be in
   contradiction to extreme programming. We discuss how we prepared our
   development and customer teams in order to achieve an agile mindset
   along with the issues we encountered in our attempts to mesh IBM's
   internal processes with our implementation of Extreme Programming.
   Finally we address some of the lessons learned as revealed by our final
   project retrospective and out future plans using agile techniques.},

Abstract = {Agile methods are compatible with formal process improvement frameworks.
   Rather than casting discipline and documentation to the wind, agile
   methods, when seriously applied, are actually very focused and
   comprehensive. Likewise, a framework such as the SEI Capability Maturity
   Model Integration (CMMI) need not be an overwhelming excess of paperwork
   and bureaucracy; when appropriately implemented, the CMMI encourages and
   enables significant and sustainable improvements.
   This paper describes the ongoing journey of DTE Energy's large IT
   organization in realizing agility and process improvement in a Fortune
   300 corporation. From following waterfall-based approaches to embracing
   agile methods, and from early attempts with the CMM to a renewed
   commitment to continuous improvement by adopting the CMM, it explores
   cultural and organizational changes that enable real-world process
   improvements.},

Abstract = {Doing agile development in a relatively inelastic environment, where
   policies and procedures are virtually unchangeable, creates an impedance
   mismatch between the agile team and its host organization. Our
   experience on a variety of embedded Java projects has shed some light on
   the costs of complying (or failing to comply), where we trialed
   everything from ``reftisal to comply{''} to ``full compliance{''}.
   Regardless of approach, there was always an associated cost, whether in
   redrafting documents, reducing functionality, spending time in meetings,
   losing focus on deliverables, or deteriorating morale. In keeping with
   the Agile philosophy, when our efforts were failing, we refactored our
   approach to managing the project in an effort to minimize the costs of
   compliance without adopting more risk to ensure success. In the end we
   were faced with the questions ``How did we fare in the end? Which costs
   were worth bearing? Was it all worth it?{''}},

Abstract = {Most significant software processes involve a wide range of disciplines,
   from programming to testing, and from documentation to database
   development. Unfortunately, agile processes are typically presented from
   the point of view of programmers, with the other disciplines often left
   feeling excluded and disenfranchised.
   One such discipline is that of user experience design (often abbreviated
   UED), a discipline encompassing several key specialties including user
   research, interface design, visual design and usability testing. UED
   activities span the full lifecycle of product development from early
   requirements analysis to construction and testing, spanning both large
   scale system issues and detailed components, with its work products
   forming key inputs and deliverables of many development activities.
   In this experience report, I discuss my coaching experiences integrating
   sophisticated UED practices into the agile process initiatives of
   several organizations. My background is initially that of a programmer
   and later that of an agile process coach, and I'll explore my journey
   understanding UED practices and how they map to popular agile processes,
   mainly Scrum {[}1] and Extreme Programming {[}2]. I'll chronicle the
   teams' struggles to come to grips with the often programming-centric
   orientation of agile processes, and their ongoing efforts to integrate
   their UED best practices into the incremental, collaborative world of
   agile processes.},

   the workload of analysis in reverse engineering, and improved the
   performance of analysis. Localized analysis made testing and tracing
   easier, so the complexity of reengineering project was reduced. Evolving

Abstract = {The world is moving rapidly toward the deployment of information and
   communication systems. Nowadays, computing systems with their fast
   growth are found everywhere and one of the main challenges for these
   systems is increasing attacks and security threats against them. Thus,
   capturing, analyzing and verifying security requirements becomes a very
   important activity in development process of computing systems,
   specially in developing systems such as banking, military and e-business
   systems. For developing every system, a process model which includes a
   process, methods and tools is chosen. The Rational Unified Process (RUP)
   is one of the most popular and complete process models which is used by
   developers in recent years. This process model should be extended to be
   used in developing secure software systems. In this paper, the
   Requirement Discipline of RUP is extended to improve RUP for developing
   secure software systems. These proposed extensions are adding and
   integrating a number of Activities, Roles, and Artifacts to RUP in order
   to capture, document and model threats and security requirements of
   system. These extensions introduce a group of clear and stepwise
   activities to developers. By following these activities, developers
   assure that security requirements are captured and modeled. These models
   are used in design, implementation and test activities.},

Abstract = {A variety of life cycle models for software systems development are
   generally available. However, it is generally, difficult to compare and
   contrast the methods and very little literature is available to guide
   dei,elopers and managers in making choices. Moreover in order to make
   informed decisions dei,elopers require access to real data that compares
   the different models and the results associated with the adoption of
   each model. This paper describes an experiment in which fifteen software
   teams developed comparable software products using four different
   development approaches (V-model, incremental, evolutionary, and Extreme
   Programming). Extensive measurements it ere taken to assess the time,
   quality, size, and development efficiency, of each product. The paper
   presents the expermental data collected and the conclusions related to
   the choice of method, its impact on the project and the quality of the
   results as well as the general implications to the practice of systems
   engineering project management.},

Abstract = {As more and more software projects engage Agile Methods, there are
   emerging patterns of success and failure. With growing adoption of Agile
   Methods, project managers increasingly need to understand the
   applicability to their projects and factors that drive key project
   performance characteristics. While some organizations affirm that Agile
   Methods solve all their problems, few have shown consistent success over
   a range of typical software projects. Agile Methods have advantages,
   especially in accommodating change due to volatile requirements.
   However, they also present concimitant risks with managing the many
   dependent pieces of work distributed across a large project. Use of
   Agile Methods therefore presents a set of tradeoffs. This paper examines
   the impact of Agile Methods on the people involved in a project, the
   process under which a project is developed, and on the project itself in
   an attempt to allow project managers to evaluate the applicability using
   an agile method.},

   how we used the visual language to implement a regression testing
   framework for compositions written in the language itself, and how we
   introduced support in the visual environment for refactorings such as
   renaming, synchronization of set-vice interface changes, and
   extraction/inlining across different levels of nesting. This is done in

Abstract = {Developers need evidence that a new technology works in a certain
   context before they promote and deploy it on a larger scale. This need
   looms greater in large organizations because of their complexity and the
   need to integrate new technologies and processes with existing ones.
   To further evaluate agile methods and their underlying software
   development practices, several Software Experience Center member
   companies initiated a series of activities to discover if agile
   practices match their organizations' needs. Based on the experiences of
   these organizations, researchers concluded that agile practices match
   the needs of large organizations, but integrating new practices with
   existing processes and quality systems that govern the conduct of
   software development requires further tailoring. The challenge here lies
   not in applying agile practices to a project, but in efficiently
   integrating the agile project into its environment.},

Abstract = {Software organizations have typically de-emphasized the importance of
   software testing. In this paper, the results of a regional survey of
   software testing and software quality assurance techniques are
   described. Researchers conducted the study during the summer and fall of
   2002 by surveying software organizations in the Province of Alberta.
   Results indicate that Alberta-based organizations tend to test less than
   their counterparts in the United States. The results also indicate that
   Alberta software organizations tend to train fewer personnel on
   testing-related topics. This practice has the potential for a two-fold
   impact: first, the ability to detect trends that lead to reduced quality
   and to identify the root causes of reductions in product quality may
   suffer from the lack of testing. This consequence is serious enough to
   warrant consideration, since overall quality may suffer from the reduced
   ability to detect and eliminate process or product defects. Second, the
   organization may have a more difficult time adopting methodologies such
   as extreme programming. Ibis is significant because other industry
   studies have concluded that many software organizations have tried or
   will in the next few years try some form of agile method. Newer
   approaches to software development like extreme programming increase the
   extent to which teams rely on testing skills. Organizations should
   consider their testing skill level as a key indication of their
   readiness for adopting software development techniques such as
   test-driven development, extreme programming, agile modelling, or other
   agile methods.},

Abstract = {The quality of software depends on the effectiveness of the software

   not flexible or practical enough for developing a system that requires a
   mix of existing processes to be used in the production of that system.
   In this paper, a formal specification language, called TUG (Tree with
   Unified Grammar), is presented to support a software development process
   that accommodates conventional software development, operational
   specification, rapid prototyping via software transformations, software
   reuse, software testing, and program proofs of correctness. The
   development process with TUG can not only allow for a mix of existing
   development processes applied to a given system but also can be adapted
   to one of existing development processes. The combination of existing
   development processes takes advantage of the strengths of each process
   in the system. The software development process with the aid of the TUG
   specification language can aid the production of reliable and reusable

   The model utilizes automatic model transformations, but in the same time
   allows room for input of tacit knowledge. It is a practice-oriented
   approach which ties together methods of business process modeling,
   object oriented, and model transformation approaches in order to support
   cognitive needs of requirements holders and object oriented software
   developers, and provide framework for explicit and transparent
   representation of mutually related business and software development
   knowledge. It utilizes tacit knowledge of stakeholders (including
   software designers), but in the same time reflects this knowledge in
   explicit and automatically reconfigurable models that form the basis for
   automatic code generation.},

Abstract = {Agile Methods are creating a buzz in the software development community,
   drawing their fair share of advocates and opponents. While some people
   consider agile methods the best thing that has happened to software
   development in recent years, other people view them as a backlash to
   software engineering and compare them to hacking.
   The aim of this chapter is to introduce the reader to agile methods
   allowing him/her to judge whether or not agile methods could be useful
   in modern software development. The chapter discusses the history behind
   agile methods as well as the agile manifesto, a statement from the
   leaders of the agile movement. It looks at what it means to be agile,
   discusses the role of management, describes and compares some of the
   more popular agile methods, provides a guide for deciding where an agile
   approach is applicable, and lists common criticisms. It Summarizes
   empirical Studies, anecdotal reports, and lessons learned from applying
   agile methods and concludes with an analysis of various agile methods.
   The target audiences for this chapter include practitioners, who will be
   interested in the discussion of the different methods and their
   applications, researchers who may want to focus on the empirical studies
   and lessons learned, and educators looking to teach and learn more about
   agile methods.},

Abstract = {Many students begin to form their software development habits in
   introductory programming courses. Although problem-solving strategies
   and other good practices are taught at the introductory level, early
   experiences in programming tend to involve small assignments and so
   students do not always see the benefits and value of good software
   engineering practices. Consequently, they develop habits which are hard
   to break later when faced with significant problems where good practices
   are essential for success. Furthermore, students report that typical CS1
   lab experiences tend to be unsatisfactory and even irrelevant. In order
   to give the students early meaningful experiences in developing good
   habits using a software engineering methodology which fits the limited
   time-constraints of the academic environment, eXtreme Programming (XP)
   was employed for the lab portion of a second semester CS1 course. This
   paper describes how XP practices were incorporated into a semester-long
   project where classes met once a week in a closed lab. Specific
   affective objectives were also introduced which were measured
   quantitatively and qualitatively. This paper describes our methodology,
   assessment, results, and plans for improvement.},

   little empirical evidence currently exists. This paper reports empirical
   results based on a study where a project team conducted a
   self-reflection process called ``post-iteration workshop{''} in order to
   improve and optimize the adopted practices in an XP project. Both
   qualitative and quantitative data were collected from four 1-2 hour
   workshops. The results show that with less than 4\% effort it is
   possible to hold post-iteration workshops that significantly help to
   improve and optimize practices and enhance the leaming and satisfaction
   of the project team.},

Abstract = {A software engineering department in a Daimler-Chrysler business unit
   was highly professional at developing embedded software for busses and
   coaches. However, customer specific add-ons were a regular source of
   hassle. Simple as they are, those individual requirements have to be
   implemented in hours or days rather than weeks or months. Poor quality
   or late upload into the bus hardware would cause serious cost and
   overhead Established software engineering methods were considered
   inadequate and needed to be cut short.
   Agile methods offer guidance when quality, flexibility and high speed
   need to be reconciled However, we did not adopt any full agile method,
   but added single agile practices to our ``process improvement
   toolbox{''}. We suggested a number of classical process improvement
   activities (such as more systematic documentation and measurement) and
   combined them with agile elements (e.g. Test First Process). This
   combination seemed to foster acceptance of agile ideas and may help us
   to break the ice for a cautious extension of agile process improvement.},

Abstract = {Software development is always a challenging undertaking and it requires
   high commitments from individuals who participate in it. Software
   development often involves new technology, challenging or unknown
   requirements, and tight schedules - making it particularly prone to
   several types of risk. These challenges are even more paramount in agile
   development and in distributed development, where the need for efficient
   information sharing is important, yet the distributed development makes
   it very difficult. This tutorial uses innovative and new learning
   methods to explore and to learn about these challenges and how to deal
   with them. The tutorial is partially based on presentations given by
   authors, but a major element in the tutorial is the case study that is
   introduced and in which will involve all the participants. The learning
   in the tutorial is strongly facilitated by participants' discussions and
   the insights generated in concrete problem solving situations.},

   releases of the same product. One release was completed just prior to
   the team's adoption of the XP methodology, and the other was completed
   after approximately two years of XP use. Comparisons of the new release
   project results to the old release project results show a 50\% increase
   in productivity, a 65\% improvement in pre-release quality, and a 35\%

Abstract = {Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a relatively new process developed in the
   early 90 ` s by The Welding Institute (TWI) of the United Kingdom. A
   rotating tool with a specific geometry is used to heat the materials to
   be joined. The heat softened material of the abutting materials is
   entrained and transfered around the tool, where it is deposited prior to
   recoalescence, thereafter forming a joint.
   The FSW process requires advanced automation to ensure consistent and
   reliable joints. This has been realized by the development of an
   experimental set-up by the integration and online monitoring of accurate
   sensors with reliable modular control software.
   With increasing productivity and quality requirements imposed by
   manufacturers, machine flexibility and scalabitity are becoming
   increasingly pertinent. On-line process monitoring facilitates the `
   adaption ` of machines able to respond to changing process parameters
   and conditions. Modular open software architectures allow flexibility in
   machine application.
   This paper introduces a fresh approach for the integration of the latest
   automation technology into an experimental setup equipped with an
   advanced sensory system. A new method of capturing sensory data and the
   implementation aspects of the software architecture for a micro-kernel
   based real-time embedded operating system is introduced. Agile
   automation of the FSW process is thus realized by advanced monitoring

Abstract = {This research aims to propose an adaptive operation of eXtreme
   Programming (a.k.a. XP) for learning developers which do not have enough
   knowledge and experiences about XP. (1) This study analyzes
   understandability, applicability and effectiveness of each XP practice
   through an experimentation of software development.
   This paper investigates the following two points: 1) how to introduce XP
   efficiently to a project which consists of members who have less
   knowledge and experience in XP, and 2) how to operate XP effectively
   including educational effects for the developers in such environment.
   Data is collected in the following procedure: 1) we request an
   experimental development of software to learning developers, 2) we give
   them various knowledge on XP incrementally, and 3) we observe their
   activities during in the development project.
   The findings of this study indicate that putting priority among
   practices would help learning developers work more easily and
   effectively on XP.},

Abstract = {Agility refers to an enterprise's ability to respond efficiently and
   effectively to all levels and types of change. From an IT perspective,
   the challenge has been to address the problems associated with the
   flexibility of business processes while taking into account the existing
   monolithic legacy IT systems. Web Services represent an emerging model
   for developing and deploying enterprise software applications by
   improving the flexibility and reach of existing IT infrastructure. At
   the least, Web Services promise to fundamentally change the manner of
   enterprise application development and deployment. It has strategic
   implications for enterprises, which form networks of interrelated
   businesses operating in a collaborative manner. Towards this, legacy IT
   systems play a limited role towards achieving the desired levels of
   business process flexibility, thereby affecting enterprise agility. In
   this paper, we have examined the predominant technology issue of
   integration, and the key role of Service Oriented Architectures, in
   enhancing business agility. The theoretical and conceptual learnings are
   used to propose a generic framework which breaks down the progression
   towards a service oriented enterprise (defined as the end goal of
   enterprise integration efforts) into four phases.},

   adaptive and not predictive, people oriented and not process oriented,
   and quality focused (Beck et al, 2001). Organizations that have adopted
   them report they were able to deliver quality software which is easy to
   maintain (Beck, 1999) in shorter time. All these methodologies use an
   object-oriented approach, which is well suited to support an iterative

Abstract = {The enterprises of today need to respond in real time to whatever the
   day brings - a change in supply or demand, a shift in the expectations
   or requirements of customers, the vagaries of capital markets or the
   aftermath of a natural disaster. This requires an infrastructure that is
   different in concept and capability at a number of fundamental levels.
   Earlier technologies are based on what the technology can do, and not
   what the business needs to do. This fundamental change of perspective is
   what IBM term ``On Demand Computing{''}.
   To evolve and apply an on ``On Demand{''} computing model in software
   engineering a software architect must incorporate an engineering
   strategy that encompasses the underlying development process, methods
   and tools. This underlying strategy is often referred to as a Software
   Engineering Paradigm. Software engineering process and architecture
   models are generally chosen based on the nature of the challenge and the
   application, the methods and tools used, and the control and
   deliverables that are required. As a consequence, the software
   engineering model typically adopted in software development projects has
   direct implications for all aspects of the project's end-to-end life
   cycle, including development, function test, system test engineering,
   performance engineering, product enablement/support incremental
   maintenance releases, and so on.
   This paper debates the need for software engineering teams to consider
   hybrid process and architecture model decisions in the context of
   motivating an optimal ``on demand{''} enterprise application development
   agenda. Consequently, we assert that evolving an ``on demand{''}
   software engineering paradigm implies new rules for software development
   organizations, where all engineering capabilities will need to support
   integration of business decisions, processes and methods. Motivating an
   ``on demand{''} engineering methodology to derive parallel competencies
   will promote new rules in all aspects of engagement and planning, and
   represents the next phase in which software development teams move
   beyond simply integrating their processes to actually being able to
   sense and respond to fluctuating conditions so to provide
   organization-wide capabilities in an ``on demand{''} way. First, an
   attempt is made to understand the essence and evolution of the computing
   paradigm. Second, the rationale for evolving an ``on demand{''}
   enterprise application development engineering model is explored. Third,
   pertinent software engineering architectural concerns are assessed,
   after which we explore key software engineering process methodologies
   that need to be considered prior to planning an optimal software
   engineering process paradigm. Finally, we shall explore considerations
   for evolving a modified software engineering agenda in the context of an
   architecturally biased process model framework.},

Abstract = {The management information models currently used in the Internet have
   several limitations. Some of them contain errors, are missing important
   features, or are difficult to understand. Second, standards bodies keep
   reinventing the wheel, which confuses the terminology (hence customers)
   and wastes precious time. Third, finding a good balance between too
   abstract and overly detailed models is a tough challenge, rarely
   achieved in practice. Last, the learning curve of existing data models
   is too steep. We propose to alleviate these problems by adopting a new
   process for designing and standardizing management information models.
   It is inspired by two techniques from software engineering: the
   iterative and incremental software development process, which addresses
   the shortcomings of the waterfall process usually adhered to by the IETF
   and DMTF; and multi-tier models, which capture different perspectives
   (e.g., analysis, design, and implementation) of the information model.
   Our main innovations are management-architecture-neutral universal
   information models (UIMs), sharing of conceptual models by different
   standards bodies, and specialization of the people involved in designing
   the different layers of the models. Our new process takes into account a
   number of constraints identified in real-life environments.},

Abstract = {Requirements change with the ebbs and flows of a business. Applications
   must be able to react to changes in the business model and, likewise,
   their technology platform (i.e., architecture) must be agile. Often, the
   operations and environment requirements of a system affect the
   application's ability to be modified quickly. This article presents a
   methodology that combines ISO standards and UML (Unified Modeling
   Language) standards. The ISO model is used to identify the quality
   characteristics for software architecture. These attributes form an
   evaluation framework. Each functional requirement is defined as a use
   case model using UML notation. This model is expanded with the specific
   quality properties required based on the ISO model. The resulting use
   cases are prioritized on the basis of their architectural impact. With
   these use cases, several candidate architectures can be identified.
   Alternatives are compared to the evaluation framework to select one
   architecture design. A real-time monitoring system is used as a case
   study to reinforce the methodology introduced in the article.},

Abstract = {We introduce the observe-mine-adopt (OMA) paradigm that assists
   organizations in making improvements to their software development
   processes without committing to and undertaking large-scale sweeping
   organizational process improvement. Specifically, the approach has been
   applied to improve software practices focused on maintainability. This
   novel approach is based on the theory that software teams naturally make
   observations about things that do or do not work well. Teams then mine
   their artifacts and their recollections of events to find the software
   products, processes, metrics, etc. that led to the observation. In the
   case of software maintainability, it is then necessary to perform some
   measurement to ensure that the methods result in improved
   maintainability. We introduce two maintainability measures,
   maintainability product and perceived maintainability, to address this
   need. Other maintainability measures that may be used in the mine step
   are also examined. Finally, if the mining activities lead to validated
   discoveries of processes, techniques or practices that improve the
   software product, they are formalized and adopted by the team. OMA has
   been studied experimentally using two project studies and a Web-based
   health care system which is maintained by a large industrial software

Journal = {BELL LABS TECHNICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Pages = {169-189},
Abstract = {With more and more air interfaces introduced into the wireless market,
   the product spectrum of different base stations by a worldwide-engaged
   infrastructure vendor becomes increasingly diverse. Therefore, it is
   desirable to shrink the product spectrum while still matching the
   different market needs. This paper presents key enabling technologies,
   such as radio frequency-microelectromechanical system (RF-MEMS) and
   silicon carbide/gallium nitride (SiC/GaN) transistors, which allow for a
   base station radio architecture that can be reconfigured. The paper
   first analyses the market scenario and compares the principles of a
   reconfigurable radio with classical software radio technology.
   Direct-mixing transceiver architecture is proposed for implementation,
   and solutions for multi-band capability are discussed. RF-MEMS devices
   are used to switch filters, tune capacitances and inductances, and
   specifically adapt impedance matching. For multi-band power amplifiers,
   the benefit of operating a SiC or GaN radio frequency (RF) power device
   at high voltage is addressed. All these technologies lead to an analog
   software radio (also called frequency agile radio) where it will turn
   out that such a radio can be realized at less complexity and cost
   compared to a classical digital software radio. Furthermore, it will
   show up that analog software radio technology based on RF-MEMS also has
   the potential to enter the terminal market. (C) 2003 Lucent Technologies

Abstract = {Extreme programming (XP) is the most well known agile software
   development method Many experience reports have been published in recent
   years. Successful XP adoptions have however been criticized for the lack
   of concrete data. While some exist, the studies are often difficult to
   compare due to different settings and the varying level of XP adoption.
   This paper reports the first results (concrete data from 215 releases)
   from a controlled extreme programming case study. Four software
   engineers were acquired to implement a system in a tight delivery
   schedule of eight weeks. Development environment was close to the agile
   home ground A comparison of the collected data from the first two
   releases is provided Analysis shows that while the first release is a
   learning effort for all stakeholders, the second release shows clear
   improvement in all regards, e.g., estimation accuracy is improved by
   26\%, productivity was increased by 12 locs/hour and yet the
   post-release defect rate remained low, i.e., 2.1 defects/KLoc.},

Abstract = {A large and growing variety of tools can support all kinds of UML
   modeling aspects: from model creation to advanced round-trip engineering
   of UML models and code.
   However such tools aim at supporting specific life-cycle phases, but
   they often do not meet basic requirements arising in heterogeneous
   environments, UML education, early, life-cycle phases, or agile
   processes: hassle-free tool deployment, support for fast model
   sketching, and flexible graphic export features.
   This paper presents the freely available modeling tool UMLet we designed
   to specifically address these basic issues. It is a flyweight Java
   application that can easily be deployed in various development
   environments; it features an intuitive and pop-up-free user interface,
   while still providing output to common high-quality publishing formats.
   Thus, the tool UMLet provides an effective way to teach UML and to
   create and share UML sketches, especially in agile environments and
   during early life-cycle phases. Its user interface supports intuitive
   and exploratory modeling, its architecture makes distribution and
   deployment cost-efficient in heterogeneous environments.},

Abstract = {Process improvement is of high importance and with crucial impact on
   business and prosperity for software developing companies. The
   requirements on software are that it needs to be produced faster,
   cheaper and with higher quality. A recent trend in software development
   is the use of agile methods. The general idea of more lightweight
   approaches can also be applied to process improvement.
   In this paper the authors describe a fault-driven lightweight process
   improvement approach to be used between projects. The objective is to
   decrease the number of faults and hence shorten the project lead-time.
   The fault-driven process improvement approach sets focus on business
   requirements and relevance for the company associated with this study.
   This paper discusses the need for a lightweight approach and introduces
   a lightweight process improvement method. It also reports on some
   findings from an industrial study and presents some conclusions.},

Abstract = {Avoiding architectural erosion helps extend the lifetime of an evolving

   at all stages of system construction and maintenance; and (iii)
   architectural changes are treated with the same care and attention as
   the production of the initial design. Through the metaphor of `agile
   development' this paper presents a lightweight approach to the control
   of architectural erosion. In particular, it covers the representation of
   an architectural description and the management of alignment between
   description and implementation during system evolution. A prototype
   support tool, ArchAngel, is introduced. This maintains an architectural
   design description, identifies when changes occur with respect to that
   description, and reports these changes for evaluation.},

Abstract = {Software Engineering is a relatively new discipline when compared to
   other more traditional engineering disciplines, such as civil,
   mechanical and so on. Several frameworks dealing with quality issues of
   software processes are being developed and implemented by software
   organizations in order to become software development more closely
   related to an engineering project. One of the most critical difficulties
   to implement them is how to interpret the generic statements of these
   models and how to transform them in daily executable activities. The
   international Standard that deals with software processes definition is
   the ISO/IEC 12207. As other generic frameworks, this Standard does not
   prescribe any specific implementation life cycle model, method or toot
   In the other hang commercial models and frameworks, such as the Rational
   Unified Process (RUP), prescribes detailed implementation guidelines.
   This paper focuses on investigating haw R UP can be used to implement
   the ISO/IEC 12207 Standard.},

Abstract = {Key technologies like the World Wide Web, object-orientation, and
   distributed computing enable new applications, e.g., in the area of
   electronic commerce, management of information systems, and decision
   support systems. Today, many companies face the problem that they have
   to reengineer pre-existing information systems to take advantage of
   these technologies. Various computer-aided reengineering tools have been
   developed to reduce the complexity of the reengineering task. A major
   limitation of current approaches, however, is that they impose a
   strictly phase-oriented, waterfall-type reengineering process, with
   little support for iterations. Still, such iterations often occur in
   real-world examples, e.g., when additional knowledge about the legacy
   system becomes available or when the legacy system is modified during an
   ongoing migration process. In this paper, we present an approach to
   incremental consistency management that allows to overcome this
   limitation in the domain of database systems by integrating reverse and
   for-ward engineering activities in an intertwined process. The described
   mechanism is based on a formalization of conceptual schema translation
   and redesign transformations by graph rewriting rules and has been
   implemented and evaluated with the Varlet database reengineering
   environment. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Agile Software Development has put a new focus on the question of how to
   share knowledge among members of software development teams. in contrast
   to heavy-weight, document-centric approaches, agile approaches rely on
   face-to-face communication for knowledge transfer. Pure face-to-face
   communication is not feasible when applying agile processes in a virtual
   team setting. In this paper, we argue that the right approach for
   virtual software development teams using agile methods lies between a
   radical ``none but source code{''} standpoint, and the multitude of
   documents proposed by heavy-weight development standards. This paper
   introduces work on developing a system for the task-based capture and
   pro-active distribution of recurrent information needs that typically
   arise for developers, as well as potential ways to satisfy these
   information needs. Our approach facilitates an incremental
   organizational learning process to capture and maintain knowledge on
   what documentation/information is actually needed, such that
   documentation is created on an ``as needed{''} basis.},

Abstract = {The main drivers of the growing ICT market are software products.
   European Information Technology Observatory estimates, that in year 2002
   the total value of ICT software products in Western Europe will be more

   quality of the software products and processes. Software Process
   Improvement tools, like CMM and ISO 9000 were to cure this situation,
   but some people complain that they are too bureaucratic and inflexible.
   As a result new, so-called agile, methodologies appeared. One of them is
   Extreme Programming (XP) - a lightweight, change-oriented and
   customer-oriented approach to software development. Although XP proposes
   many interesting practices, it has some limitations. Moreover, it is not
   clear how to introduce XP to an organization certified to ISO 9001:2000.
   The aim of the paper is to present a modified version of XP that would
   be acceptable from the point of view of ISO 9000.},

Abstract = {Refinement calculus {[}1,5] is a formal framework for reasoning about
   program correctness and correctness preserving program refinements. It
   serves as the foundation for an object-oriented software, architecture
   and construction method that we refer to as stepwise feature
   introduction (SFI) {[}3]. Characteristic for this approach is that each
   software module is described in terms of thin layers. Each layer extends
   the software with some new feature, in a way that preserves the features
   that have been introduced by earlier layers. This amounts to requiring
   that the new layer is a superposition refinement {[}4] of the layers
   below. The modules are interconnected using interface specifications,
   usually providing a more abstract view of the module state than what
   will actually be implemented. The implementation is required to be a
   data refinement {[}9,6] of the interface specification. SFI is based on
   structuring software with these two basic mechanisms, modularization and
   extension, while the refinement calculus provides the formal framework
   for reasoning about the correctness of software constructed in this way.
   We use UML {[}8] to describe the software architecture, with refinement
   calculus providing a rigorous mathematical semantics for the UML
   constructs employed. This will also give us a formal framework for
   reasoning about UML class diagrams, in essence using these as proof
   schemes when arguing about software properties.
   SFI goes well in hand with an extreme programming (XP) {[}7] approach to
   constructing software, with feature introductions corresponding to the
   iteration cycles in XP. We can look at SFI as providing a general
   software architecture for XP, and we can look at XP as providing a
   software process for SFI. We will report on some experiments where these
   two approaches have been combined {[}2]. We will also discuss in more
   detail how the notions of unit tests in XP can be generalized to
   requirement specifications in SFI.},

Abstract = {Extreme Programming (XP) is an agile (lightweight) software development
   methodology and it becomes more and more popular. X-P proposes many
   interesting practices, but it also has some weaknesses. From the
   software engineering point of view the most important issues are:
   maintenance problems resulting from very limited documentation (XP
   relies on code and test cases only), and lack of wider perspective of a
   system to be built. Moreover, XP assumes that there is only one customer
   representative. In many cases there are several representatives (each
   one with his own view of the system and different priorities) and then
   some XP practices should be modified. In the paper we assess XP from two
   points of view: the Capability Maturity Model and the Sommerville-Sawyer
   Model, We also propose how to introduce documented requirements to XP,
   how to modify the Planning Game to allow many customer representatives
   and how to get a wider perspective of a system to be built at the
   beginning of the project lifecycle.},

   acting as ``market arbiter{''}, OSE optimization,for individual entities
   can lead to efficient group-level spectrum utilization solutions. We
   further contend that the solutions thus obtained will be of at least

Abstract = {User stories form the heart of the Extreme Programming methodology
   planning game. In its turn, Extreme Programming is one of the supporting
   pillars of the wider Agile Software Development process. The user
   stories form a set of central work products that determine the software
   development processes. In the spirit of Extreme Programming the
   production of user stories is kept as simple as possible. Traditionally,
   user stories are hand written on index cards as the), are easy to store,
   display, rearrange and distribute to the co-located development team.
   However, virtually, all other work products of an application
   development team are in electronic format, and Agile Software
   development is increasingly being adopted by teams working from remote
   locations. In these circumstances distributed development teams look to
   software solutions for creating and using user stories. This paper
   surveys some of the tools that are being used and examines their
   suitability, for the task using a set of requirements.
   As a result of this investigation the author has produced a prototype
   user story software tool for Agile Software Development called
   DotStories. The paper concludes by discussing the features of DotStories
   and its how closely it can approach the ideal user story software tool.
   Indeed, the proposition that software tools can ever improve on index
   cards is considered in the light of experience to date.},

Abstract = {RUP is a Use Case Driven, Architecture Centric (4+1) and Iterative \&
   Incremental. We believe that, RUP needs to be Requirement Driven,
   Architecture Centric (4R1) and Iterative, Incremental and Improving
   process.
   This paper presents a process patterns definition for RUP including
   pattern called ``Software Requirement Modeling Pattern (RMP){''} in the
   RUP framework. The 4+1 software architecture used in RUP is extended to
   support Requirement Modeling Pattern. It is shown that, to include
   process pattern, RUP needs to be a Requirement Driven Approach.
   Requirement Modeling Pattern is applied in the RUP framework according
   to our definition of process pattern. Our aim is the extension of
   requirement types. In fact, a new requirement type called ``Software
   Process Requirement{''} is defined and some problems of the software
   development process domain are involved in it.
   There are three questions that must be addressed. First, ``How the
   behavior of requirements are represented?{''} second, ``In which
   repository the states of requirements are saved?{''} third, ``Which
   transformation exist from model elements to real requirements?{''}. We
   show that the proposed process pattern needs Requirement Driven
   Approach. In the proposed process pattern, UML is used as a
   specification, visualization, modeling, and documentation language. In
   Requirement Driven Approach (instead of Use Case Driven Approach in
   RUP), some relationships between requirement artifact classes are
   highlighted by a model.
   Rational Rose and Rational RequisitePro are used to manage the Artifact
   Life Cycle and control the requirements. To use the Requirement Driven
   Approach (RDA) we need a modified software architecture, and inclusion
   of a new view called ``Requirement View{''}. By using this view, we
   change the name of Software Architecture from (4+1) to (4R1), where R
   indicates the ``Requirements{''}.
   In summary, the 4R1 Software Architecture is given which is a superset
   of the 4+1 Software Architecture. A Requirement Model is associated to
   Requirement View, and the proposed process pattern is defined based on
   the new view.},

Abstract = {The specification of real-time imaging systems has traditionally been
   performed using a mix of structured modeling techniques and operational
   descriptions with scant regard for consistent abstractions, analyzable
   models or maintenance needs. This is not because structured approaches
   cannot cope with these issues, but rather that the user community has
   not adopted them; preferring individualistic methods. It could be
   reasonably surmised that this is in part due to a lack of understanding
   and/or appreciation for the software engineering practices that have
   been developed over the decades since the waterfall model of software
   development was introduced. That is to say, most experienced
   practitioners of imaging systems are not, in general, software
   engineers, but, rather, imaging engineers that construct their systems,
   or parts of, in software. There is, nevertheless, a need to address the
   status quo.
   This paper suggest the use of UML combined with a rigorous formal
   method, the Q-model, for the specification and design of real-time
   imaging systems. A short case study is presented to illustrate the
   proposed approach.},

Abstract = {Traditionally Software Engineering research has focused on the needs of
   very large corporations undertaking equally mammoth and complex
   development projects. Thus most tools and methods are predicated on this
   model. Yet by far the majority of software development is undertaken by
   Small to Medium Enterprises, often with little or no adherence to any SE
   standard process or by attempting to tailor processes intended for
   larger organizations. Neither of these alternatives is ideal, with both
   introducing new risk factors.
   The explosion in internet based applications has partly fuelled the move
   away from monolithic software development but has also introduced an
   entirely new set of possible risks. Indeed, the very nature of some of
   these applications can be described as ``critical{''} and are therefore
   candidates for formal risk assessment procedures.
   The so-called Agile methods now offer a third alternative for the SME
   software developer. However, are they a solution or simply adding yet
   another element of risk to an already risky business? This paper
   examines some of the factors that contribute to making software
   development today such a risky proposition then discusses whether Agile
   methods can assist SMEs in meeting these challenges.},

Number = {3},
Pages = {227-235},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {The paper proposes the combination of three traditional modelling
   methods (analytical, continuous and discrete-event), into a unique
   hybrid two-level modelling approach, to address software process
   simulation modelling issues. At the higher abstraction level. the
   process is modelled by a discrete-event queueing network, which
   represents the component activities, their interactions, and the
   exchanged artefacts. At the lower abstraction level, the analytical and
   continuous methods are used to describe the behaviour of the introduced
   activities.
   The hybrid approach is applied to a waterfall-based software process to
   study the effects of requirements instability on various process quality
   attributes, such as effort, delivery time, productivity, rework
   percentage and product quality. Simulation results show that the use of
   the model can provide both qualitative and quantitative suggestions on
   how to improve the software process or on how to satisfy specific
   organisational needs.
   Although, the model has been primarily designed to represent the
   behaviour of hypothetical projects, and to allow researchers to view the
   implications of their assumptions, it can be easily customised and
   extended to become a tool for analysing and predicting the behaviour of
   actual projects. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Since the software radio concept was introduced, much progress has been
   made in the past few years in making it a reality. Many
   software-radio-based systems have been designed through the development
   efforts of both commercial and noncommercial organizations. While the
   term software radio has meant many things, the ultimate goal in software
   radio has been the realization of an agile radio that can transmit and
   receive signals at any carrier frequency using any protocol, all of
   which can be reprogrammed virtually instantaneously. Such a system
   places great demands on the limits of data converter and processor
   technologies since it requires real-time disposition of gigasamples of
   data produced by direct conversion of wireless signals into digital
   data. From a processing standpoint, the challenge in software radio is
   to exploit the three basic processor types - fixed architecture
   processors, FPGAs, and programmable DSPs/ RISCs/CISCs - in such a way as
   to optimize the three-way trade-offs between speed, power dissipation,
   and programmability. With respect to the latter characteristic, the
   issues of high-level language interfaces, portability, and reprogramming
   speed must be considered. This article describes the architecture and
   operation of a PC-based software radio receiver. The development
   environment is a real-time PC-based platform that allows testing to be
   done in a simple manner using the main software functionality of a PC.
   The front-end of the receiver implemented in hardware represents a novel
   wideband design (bandwidth of up to 100 MHz centered at a carrier
   frequency of up to 2 GHz) that functionally converts wireless signals
   directly into a gigasample digital data stream in the receiver (and vice
   versa in the transmitter). This direct conversion approach shows the
   greatest promise in realizing the main goal of software radio.},

Volume = {50},

Abstract = {Existing software-reliability models estimate the software failure
   intensity function during dynamic testing. While these models are useful
   engineering tools, they cannot be applied to earlier life-cycle phases
   (e.g., requirements analysis, design, coding) and do not provide insight
   into the nature of human errors that occur during software development.
   Two broad categories of human error occur during software development:
   1) development errors made during requirements analysis, design, and
   coding activities;
   2) debugging errors made during attempts to remove faults identified
   during software inspections and dynamic testing.
   This paper describes a stochastic model that relates the software
   failure intensity function to development and debugging error occurrence
   throughout all software life-cycle phases. Software failure intensity is
   related to development and debugging errors because data on development
   and debugging errors are available early in the software life-cycle and
   can be used to create early predictions of software reliability.
   Software reliability then becomes a variable which can be controlled up
   front, viz, as early as possible in the software development life-cycle.
   The model parameters were derived based on data reported in the open
   literature. A procedure to account for the impact of influencing factors
   (e.g., experience., schedule pressure) on the parameters of this
   stochastic model is suggested. This procedure is based on the `success
   likelihood methodology (SLIM). The stochastic model is then used to
   study the introduction and removal of faults and to calculate the
   consequent failure intensity value of a small-software developed using a
   waterfall software development.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {56},
Number = {1},
Pages = {81-90},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Validation testing of software processes may provide both qualitative
   and quantitative suggestions to understand the ways to change the
   software process to improve its quality, or the ways to achieve specific
   organisation's needs. In many cases, however, such understanding has to
   be done without affecting the actual environment. To this purpose, this
   paper introduces the use of process simulators for validation testing.
   To be effective, however, simulators must combine the ability to sustain
   the complexity of the modelling problem with the so-called dynamic
   estimation capability, that is the capability of representing the
   dynamics of the simulated process. To achieve such objectives, the
   introduced simulator is based on the association of three conventional
   modelling methods (analytical, continuous and discrete-event) into a
   unique hybrid multi-level new model, called dynamic capability model
   (DCM). The paper applies DCM in the context of a waterfall-based
   software process to study the effects of three different quality
   assurance management policies on given process quality attributes, as
   effort, delivery time, productivity, rework percentage, and product
   quality. The verification of the simulator representativeness is also
   performed by reproducing empirically known facts in the process
   behaviour. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {For the past 40 years, the techniques processes and methods of software
   development have been dominated by supply-side issues, giving rise to a
   software industry oriented towards developers rather than users. To
   achieve the levels of functionality, flexibility and time to market
   required by users, a radical shift is required in the development of
   software, with a more demand-centric view leading to software which will
   be delivered as a service within the framework of an open marketplace.
   Already, there are some signs that this approach is being adopted by
   industry but in a vary limited way We summarise research and a research
   method which has resulted in a long-term strategic view of software
   engineering innovation. Based on this foundation, we describe more
   recent work which has resulted in an innovative demand-side model for
   the future of software. We propose a service architecture in which
   components may be bound instantly, just at the time they are needed and
   then the binding may be discarded A major benefit of this approach is
   that it leads to highly flexible and agile software, that should be able
   to meet rapidly changing business needs.},

Abstract = {Knowledge is a human construction. Everything people do and create,
   including their organizations is thus human constructed. The process of
   knowledge construction is as much a part of an organization's
   distinctiveness as is its knowledge content. Knowledge binding is one
   model for studying this process. Knowledge binding refers to the
   relative distance between a specification and its implementation. This
   distance governs the very character of nrl organization: its structure,
   processes, culture, and so on, and is largely responsible Sor business
   success or failure. Comparatively stable nineteenth and
   twentieth-century business environments favored early knowledge binding
   - long lead-lime between specification and implementation, and thus gave
   rise to organization with predictable characteristics, such as
   hierarchies, waterfall software development models, management by
   objectives, top-down management processes, etc. In contrast, the
   dynamicity of twenty-first century business environment requires late
   knowledge binding (i.e., short distance and lime between specification
   and implementation), and gives rise to organizations with a whole new
   set of characteristics.},

Abstract = {Developing automated assembly systems normally happens an two distinct
   stages: first an ``off-line{''} stage in which the system is designed
   and programmed in simulated and then an ``on-line{''} stage in which the
   simulation results are used to minimize the deployment and integration
   time of the physical machines. The distinction is so great that usually
   completely different software environments are used in the design phase
   than are used in the deployment and operation phase. We are developing
   The Architecture for Agile Assembly (AAA)I a comprehensive, integrated
   framework that is designed to blur these stages together and ease the
   transitions between them, We have used the protocols of AAA to create an
   integrated interface tool which can be used throughout the life-cycle of
   a developing AAA factory, from its design to its operation. We have
   tested the integrated interface tool both in simulation and with our
   prototype hardware, which is designed for high precision
   four-degree-of-freedom assembly.},

Abstract = {Various activities associated with software development are now being
   standardized in the software life cycle process (SLCP) which is under
   review at ISO. In developing telecommunications software by taking a
   conventional approach to software development, the structured design
   technique based on the waterfall model has so far been used in a
   software development process which is one of the elements composing
   SLCP. It is pointed out, however, that this conventional design
   technique has limitations with respect to the transference of technology
   and quality evaluation. On the other hand, new techniques of software
   development, such as object-oriented programming, prototyping, and
   spiral modeling are being introduced into computer software development.
   These new development techniques are expected to provide a solution to
   the transference of technology and other problems related to software
   development. In practice, however, introduction of these techniques to
   the development of telecommunications software is delayed because the
   scale of development is relatively large, a high level of real-time
   performance is sought, memory capacity is limited, and other reasons.
   With the emergence of a general-purpose telecommunications operating
   system (OS), upgrading of development environments, and decreasing cost
   of memory in recent years, it is now becoming possible to introduce
   these new techniques into the field of computer software development.
   Against this background, we applied a new development approach based on
   spiral modeling to the development of telecommunications software and
   compared it with the conventional development approach with respect to
   the productivity of software development, the qualify of software
   programs, and other factors. Although the man-hour control and some
   other technical problems were left unsolved in experimenting with this
   new development approach based on spiral modeling, we were able to
   obtain overall good results regarding productivity and the quality of
   software. (C) 1998 Scripta Technica.},

Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {Most everyone in our field acknowledges that software process
   improvement cannot succeed unless management is committed to
   implementing it. Fortunately, the move to SPI can be a two-way street,
   initiated as easily from the bottom up as from the top down. Taking this
   bottom-up approach, I present some tricks that practitioners down in the
   trenches can use to win upper management's approval of and support for
   SPI.
   My first opportunity to introduce bottom-up process changes occurred on
   a project in which my job was basically coding and testing. Initially, I
   was assigned to the maintenance coding of the product's previous
   release, which proved to be a real headache. So I had my motives for
   making improvements.
   According to the waterfall model we were using, the project was about
   halfway through the design phase. A lot of lower-level design and unit
   and integration testing remained. I was assigned one part of the system,
   and the remaining design and unit testing tasks were given to the 15
   people we had allocated to us for the next five months. Given the amount
   of work that lay before us, these resources were not nearly enough. One
   subproject leader realized that our complex and lengthy design task
   would prove a huge challenge.},

Abstract = {DoD's Demo III research program has entered its second year. DoD is
   examining technologies developed and evaluated within Demo III as one of
   a number of approaches which might be used in the future to reduce
   hazards to our military forces while enabling them to more rapidly
   deploy to distant locations and operate with reduced logistics. The core
   of Demo III is the sensor, computing architecture and computing
   hardware-software development which are prerequisites for autonomous
   vehicle perception of and maneuver in the land combat environment. This
   effort integrates leading edge military concepts with advanced
   technology development and integration. The program provides a unique
   opportunity to evaluate a group of technically and conceptually
   interdependent initiatives through an iterative series of constructive
   wargames, virtual simulations and field exercises with troops. This
   technology development style shares many features with simulation based
   design and the spiral development model, particularly the exceptionally
   early involvement of the customer (in this instance the military user)
   in the entire endeavor.
   During the first year of the program the technology team responsible for
   simulation and modeling, terrain-obstacle sensing, and perception,
   computing, communication, navigation, mission package selection and
   safety/field exercise support was organized, initial data collection and
   evaluation of early sensor/algorithm candidates for obstacle detection
   were completed and an overall system control architecture (4D-RCS)
   consistent with multivehicle maneuver and intelligent behaviors was
   developed. Demo III's technology integration contract for four
   Experimental Unmanned Vehicles was competitively awarded in January 98.
   The integration effort will provide the infrastructure required to have
   troops interact with the technologies through three successive
   development/experimentation cycles. The second year of the program will
   see field evaluations of subsystem technologies, completion of
   preliminary and critical design reviews, and an initial troop field
   exercise.
   At its conclusion in the summer of 2001 Demo III will enable troop
   experimentation with small, highly agile, unmanned vehicles capable of
   off-road, semi-autonomous operation at speeds of up to 32 km/hr during
   daylight and 16 km/hr at night. These capabilities will be integrated
   with navigation, mission planning and target acquisition technologies
   which will enable a meaningful assessment of the promise of autonomous
   robotic ground vehicles early in the next century. Many of the Demo III
   initiatives will benefit from and/or provide technology transfer to
   other defense and civil sector robotic vehicle development programs.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PRODUCT INNOVATION MANAGEMENT},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {21-34},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Manufacturers focus on becoming more agile, software firms deploy rapid
   application development tools-everyone is in a hurry. Although we all
   understand the benefits of being first to market, we understand just as
   clearly that not all first-to-market products enjoy the same,
   sustainable benefits from being market pioneers. Why do some pioneering
   products experience a more significant order-of-entry effect than
   others?
   Roger A. Kerin, Gurumurthy Kalyanaram, and Daniel J. Howard examine two
   factors-product hierarchy and brand strategy-which may influence the
   magnitude of this effect for new consumer packaged goods. First, they
   hypothesize that pioneering a new product class offers a greater
   advantage than introducing a new form to an existing product class.
   Second, they predict that the order-of-entry effect will be greater for
   brand extensions than for entirely new brands. Finally, considering both
   product hierarchy and brand strategy, they expect that the
   order-of-entry advantage for brand extensions over new brands will be
   significantly greater within new product classes than for new forms of
   existing products.
   These hypotheses are tested using data from the Information Resources,
   Inc. Behaviorscan(R) data set. Collected from 2,500 household panel
   members, 75 supermarkets, and 25 drugstores, this database contains
   weekly measures of brand trial penetration as well as brand
   distribution, price, and promotion information in eight geographic
   markets from the period 1983-1988. The models developed in this study
   explore the relationships among brand trial penetration, product
   hierarchy, brand strategy, order of entry, lag time between successive
   brand entrants, and marketing mix variables (i.e., price, promotion,
   distribution, and advertising).
   The study strongly supports all three hypotheses. In particular the
   analysis clearly demonstrates that the order-of-entry effect is greatest
   for a new product class pioneered by a brand extension. Order of entry
   has the least effect on a new product form pioneered by an entirely new
   brand. For a company seeking a competitive advantage from being first to
   market, innovation ill product function offers greater potential benefit
   than innovation in product form. Such a company can also benefit from
   building on the name and reputation of its established brands. Although
   the study finds these order-of-entry effects significant, the effects of
   marketing mix variables such as product price and promotion are
   consistently stronger.},

Number = {5},
Pages = {1623-1643},

Abstract = {We introduce a new kind of diagnostic sensor that combines
   multifunctional measurement capabilities for ionospheric research.
   Multifunctionality is realized through agility in frequency selection
   over an extended band (1.5 to 50 MHz), system modularity, complete
   system control by software written in C, and a user-friendly computer
   interface. This sensor, which we call the frequency-agile radar (FAR),
   incorporates dual radar channels and an arbitrary wave-form synthesizer
   that allows creative design of sophisticated waveforms as a means of
   increasing its sensitivity to weak signals while minimizing loss in
   radar resolution. The sensitivity of the FAR is determined by two sets
   of power amplifier modules: four 4-kW solid-state broadband amplifiers,
   and four 30-kW vacuum tube amplifiers. FAR control is by an AT-bus
   personal computer with on-line processing by a programmable array
   processor. The FAR does not simply house the separate functions of most
   radio sensors in use today, it provides convenient and flexible access
   to those functions as elements to be used in any combination. Some of
   the first new results obtained with the FAR during recent field
   campaigns are presented to illustrate its versatility. These include (1)
   the first detection of anomalous high-frequency (HF) reflections from a
   barium ion cloud, (2) the first evidence of unexpectedly large drifts
   and a shear north of the equatorial electrojet, (3) the first HF radar
   signature of a developing equatorial plasma bubble, and (4) the first
   measurements by a portable radar of altitude-extended, quasi-periodic
   backscatter from midlatitude sporadic E. We also mention the potential
   of the FAR for atmospheric remote sensing.},

Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Pages = {207-217},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This work is about the formal specification of transaction-based,
   interactive information systems. A transaction is a task that the user
   can execute independently, and the system can be defined as a partially
   ordered set of transactions. The general framework is the
   transformational paradigm, based on the classical Waterfall development
   model 1281. The stages are systems analysis, software specification,
   design, and implementation. In this work, the systems analysis and
   software specification stages are covered.
   An informal, transaction-oriented method for systems analysis is
   proposed. The resulting system specification involves two parts: a
   high-level specification of each transaction and a formal specification
   of the system's control flow, i.e., the order of execution of the
   transactions. The system's control flow is expressed in a formal
   language describing concurrent regular expressions built on transaction
   names. The detailed specification and design of a transaction was
   covered in an earlier article {[}3].
   At the software specification stage, some operational requirements, such
   as connect/disconnect transactions and the application of the
   all-or-nothing principle, are added to the system specification. Then a
   serial product automaton (SPA) is used to transform the concurrent
   expression into a single regular expression. This result is proven to be
   consistent with the system specification.},

Journal = {KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS},
Year = {1991},
Volume = {4},
Number = {4},
Pages = {186-196},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Knowledge-based systems have often been criticized for the limited
   theoretical base on which they are constructed.  The partially valid
   view, held by many, is that systems are often constructed in an ad hoc,
   individual way, which leads to unmaintainable, unreliable, and
   unrigorous systems.  This holds even though there have been several
   attempts at producing development methodologies to assist the knowledge
   engineer in the construction process1-7.  A large contributing reason
   for the limited applicability of these methodologies is that they often
   too closely follow the waterfall model approach used for the development
   of conventional software systems8.  This approach forces developers to
   make large jumps in the system state during development, which is not
   necessarily the most conductive way to model the domain accurately.
   The paper therefore aims to introduce a new alternative approach that
   shows the benefits of taking a software engineering philosophy towards
   the development of knowledge-based systems.  The methodology breaks down
   the process of creating a knowledge-based system into constituent parts
   and discusses ways of creating rigorous specifications for those parts,
   as applicable.  This includes specifying the knowledge base, the
   representation, the control architecture, etc., thus promoting quality
   systems that are better specified, more reliable, and easier to
   maintain.},
