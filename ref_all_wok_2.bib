  abstract = {Business processes need to be agile and flexible to help organizations
	stay competitive. For this purpose, SOA promises the reuse of already
	existing information system functionality for enabling enterprises
	to change the business processes more quickly. However, many promises
	made by SOA authors have not found their way into practice, because
	methodological guidance that constructively assures a more successful
	SOA application is still missing. In this article, service-oriented
	requirements engineering is therefore introduced as a discipline
	aiming at a better and more systematic handling and alignment of
	SOA and Business Process Management. Our industrial experience in
	this regard is also described. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons,

  abstract = {Embedded systems are widely used in diverse areas, such as avionics,
	consumer electronics, and medical equipments, causing a considerable
	impact on modern society. Since these systems sometimes deal directly
	with human lives, and require a considerable level of quality, their
	development should be subject to a rigorous process. In another perspective,
	agile methods (or agile processes) have been adopted by the software
	industry as a lightweight, iterative, and collaborative approach
	for developing software systems. Although agile methods do not seem
	to be suitable to embedded systems, they have been successfully used
	for building such systems. However, there exists no detailed and
	analytical overview of the use of such methods in the embedded systems
	domain. The main objective of this paper is to present a detailed
	view of how agile methods have been used in the development of embedded
	systems, and to describe their benefits, challenges, and limitations.
	For this, we have applied Systematic Review, a technique for systematically
	exploring, organizing, summarizing, and assessing potentially all
	works conducted in a specific research area. As the main result,
	we have observed that agile methods have brought advantages to embedded
	systems development; however, more studies should be conducted. Furthermore,
	this work is also intended to contribute to the identification of
	important new research lines.},

  abstract = {It is presently required agile and systematic solutions aiming at
	streamlining the development, maintenance and configuration of complex
	Building Automation Systems (BASs) in an energy aware manner. We
	aim at defining usable Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) using a Software
	Language Engineering (SLE), as systematic approach for language development,
	and develop the right tools for specifying the behavior of BASs components
	along with their energy-related requirements. The goal is to not
	only assist the systems engineers while rapid-prototyping/ developing
	affordable, high-quality, energy-efficient(EE) BASs, but also to
	take advantage of high level abstractions, efficient special-purpose
	verification algorithms and analysis tools for early validation and
	verification, in order to promote Quality of the generated software
	products. We are watching to the rise of Model-Driven Development
	as the pragmatic approach to build them, since this approach is based
	on the notion of explicit abstractions/models. This is achieved thanks
	to model transformations that, besides automatically translating
	any specification of a given language into other execution specifications,
	also allow us to derive analysis specifications. The problem with
	the referred types of transformation purposes is that we cannot guarantee
	quality and coherence between the derived specifications into execution
	specifications and combine it with analysis specifications unless
	we can either make use of testing over the execution, with the problems
	already known, or have mechanisms to study the transformations. While
	this problem is motivated by the concrete need of developing BASs,
	we foresee that it can be of general application in SLE. In this
	position paper we will give a state of the art in Building Automation
	and we give an overview of a possible solution that uses MDD and
	model transformations, in the context of a BAS solution, in order
	to check their correctness in w.r.t. the formal semantics of the
	languages used in the target platforms (i.e either execution or analysis).},

  abstract = {In today's dynamic market environments, producing high quality software
	rapidly and efficiently is crucial. In order to allow fast and reliable
	development processes, several agile methodologies have been designed
	and are now quite popular. Although existing agile methodologies
	are abundant, companies are increasingly interested in the construction
	of their own customized methods to fit their specific environment.
	In this paper, we investigate how agile methods can be constructed
	in-house to address specific software process needs. First, we examine
	a case study focusing on the tailoring of two agile methodologies,
	XP and Scrum. Then, we focus on the high-level scope of any agile
	method customization and investigate an approach based on the Situational
	Method Engineering (SME) paradigm that includes measurement concepts
	for constructing context specific agile methodologies. We also examine
	several existing metamodels proposed for use in SME. Finally, we
	introduce an agile metamodel designed to support the construction
	of agile methods and relying on measurements to provide guidance
	to agile methodologists during the construction phase and throughout
	the development process itself.},

  abstract = {Code reviews are an integral part of the development of a dependable
	system such as for airport operations. It is commonly accepted that
	code reviews are an effective quality assurance technique even if
	a rigorous application is also a high cost factor. For large software
	systems a formal method may be inapplicable throughout the whole
	codebase. In this study an airport operational database (AODB) is
	developed with the application of a more lightweight approach to
	code reviews. A continuous, distributed and change-based process
	is applied by the development team and evaluated in comparison to
	team walkthroughs (IEEE-1028) as a baseline method. The application
	showed to be highly useful, equally effective as the baseline, but
	more efficient especially for the preparation, execution and rework
	effort. The results show that continuous code reviews also support
	the understanding of the codebase and the concept of collective ownership.
	Such processes may not completely substitute a more formal and effortful
	technique. Especially for reviewing critical design aspects or complex
	items a traditional approach is still more appropriate. The main
	outcome is that such lightweight code reviews may be used together
	with more formal approaches to ensure a high coverage and that the
	degree of formalism should be adopted to the criticality of the item

	A negative relationship is found between flexible project planning

	technological turbulence contributes to the choice of flexible or

	likely to adopt flexible approaches to innovation in an attempt to
	adapt to external pressures. In technologically innovative projects,
	product specifications are likely to remain fixed while. project
	organization is likely to be adapted to the needs of the project:
	Taken together, the findings suggest that innovation projects should
	maintain stable organization, schedules and budgets, but stay flexible
	about product specifications. Vigilance with regards to external
	and internal conditions of technological turbulence, which may lead
	organizations to be more flexible in terms of project planning, is

  abstract = {Agile methods gain the upper hand over traditional software development
	methods when it comes to constant customer participation, customer
	satisfaction with early project delivery and acceptance of requirement
	changes at any stage of software development life cycle. So the practice
	of agile methods has been increasing in recent years. Some of the
	well-known agile methods that are in practice today are Adaptive
	Software Development, Feature Driven Development, Scrum, eXtreme
	Programming. A comparison among different agile methods helps managers
	who need to introduce agility into their organization by providing
	a thorough knowledge on different features and aspects of the agile
	methods. By comparing different agile methods, managers can easily
	choose the agile method that best suites his project requirements
	and organizational characteristics. Different comparison techniques
	to compare agile methods were introduced in recent years by researchers.
	We have compared the agile methods Adaptive Software Development
	and Feature Driven Development in order to evaluate their degree
	of agility and coverage degree with respect to the two Knowledge
	Areas of SWEBOK, (1) Software Requirements, (2) Software Construction.
	The result of our comparison shows that Adaptive Software Development
	mainly differs from Feature Driven Development because there are
	no predefined techniques or specific practices that are meant to
	be followed in Adaptive Software Development. Feature Driven Development
	has some predefined techniques or practices that are to be followed
	during software development. The principle of Adaptive Software Development
	is to focus more on results rather than steps to achieve that result.
	A technique is only implemented if it is necessary to get the best
	output in Adaptive Software Development.},

  abstract = {The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has recently
	begun an effort to further refine its Fractionated Spacecraft vision.
	This vision (called the. ``F6{''} program) seeks to explore distributed
	spacecraft architectures capable of performing complex functions
	similar to current monolithic spacecrafts. However, the ability of
	fractionated systems to work separately would provide significant
	benefits not achievable by monolithic systems. The question of interest
	to this study was ``Can these benefits be quantified and evaluated
	in a meaningful fashion in order to compare them to monolithic architectures?{''}
	Rather than narrowing the approach to one or two concepts, the strategy
	was to expand the decision space in order to generate and evaluate
	a variety of alternatives under different scenarios and design choices.
	The stimuli were specifically selected to capture many issues not
	included in such studies such as technology obsolescence, funding
	profile changes, equipment failure scenarios, and even changes to
	mission objectives during the mission. Each stimulus has a variety
	of decision options or responses which a manager can exercise including
	delay, cancellation, acceleration of a development, or even new developments.
	It is argued that the very nature of fractionation will result in
	systems far more agile to external (and internal) stimuli, but this
	has never been shown explicitly. This study explores the use of Real
	Options in conjunction with traditional Net Present Value techniques
	to quantify the desirability of alternative candidate designs in
	terms of their adaptability and survivability. Our approach to evaluating
	the business case for each use case was to explicitly model both
	the implementation and operation phases for the life cycle of a fractionated
	cluster. The models were integrated into Phoenix Integration's ModelCenter
	(R) framework and used to generate Implementation Value Metrics (IVMs)
	and Operational Value Metrics (OVMs) associated with the use cases
	under evaluation. A number of models were developed to support these
	evaluations using Excel, Matlab, and Arena (R) (a commercial discrete-event
	simulation software product). The Model-Based Systems Engineering
	(MBSE) approach used in this study yielded transformations between
	high-level frameworks (OWL and SysML) and the models used to generate
	the data we needed for the evaluation. This rule-based transformation
	process will be critical for exploring the large decision trade spaces
	in a reasonable amount of time. This paper presents the results of
	the business case analyses; the underlying OVM's and IVM's, the approaches
	used to model the problem, explore the tradespace, refine the exploration,
	and generate results. We also discuss possible directions for future
	work. Specifically, it should be noted that while the approach described
	herein is being developed for, and funded by, DARPA, it has general
	applicability to a much wider variety of applications.},

	simulation environment with reliable hardware performance for high
	fidelity and repeatable evaluation of heterogeneous CR networks.
	This approach extends CR design only at device (software-defined-radio)
	or lower-level protocol (dynamic spectrum access) level to end-to-end
	cognitive networking, and facilitates low-cost deployment, development,
	and experimentation of new wireless network protocols and applications
	on frequency-agile programmable radios. Going beyond the channel
	emulator paradigm for point-to-point communications, we can support
	simultaneous transmissions by network-level emulation that allows
	realistic physical-layer interactions between diverse user classes,including
	secondary users, primary users, and adversarial jammers in CR networks.
	In particular, we can replay field tests in a lab environment with
	real radios perceiving and learning the dynamic environment thereby
	adapting for end-to-end goals over distributed spectrum coordination
	channels that replace the common control channel as a single point
	of failure. CR networks offer several dimensions of tunable actions
	including channel, power, rate, and route selection. The proposed
	network evaluation platform is fully programmable and can reliably
	evaluate the necessary cross-layer design solutions with configurable
	optimization space by leveraging the hardware experiments to represent
	the realistic effects of physical channel, topology, mobility, and
	jamming on spectrumagility, situational awareness, and network resiliency.
	We also provide the flexibility to scale up the test environment
	by introducing virtual radios and establishing seamless signal-level
	interactions with real radios. This holistic wireless evaluation
	approach supports a large-scale,hete rogeneous, and dynamic CR network
	architecture and allows developing cross-layer network protocols

  abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) appeal to a wide range of applications

	WSNs are subject to many threats. In particular, lack of pervasive

	compromise. Having compromised a sensor, the adversary learns all
	the sensor secrets, allowing it to later encrypt/decrypt or authenticate
	messages on behalf of that sensor. This threat is particularly relevant
	in the novel unattended wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) scenario.
	UWSNs operate without constant supervision by a trusted sink. UWSN's
	unattended nature and increased exposure to attacks prompts the need

	reveals how new trends in software engineering (i.e. agile methods,
	distributed development, and flat management structures) interplayed

	of agile program management and system engineering in a high risk
	technology application where utilizing and implementing new, untraditional

	spacecraft for a military/DOD application in a record breaking time

	adaptation and application of concepts developed in agile software
	engineering to hardware product and system development for critical
	military applications. This challenging spacecraft did not use existing
	key technology (heritage hardware) and created a large paradigm shift
	from traditional spacecraft development. The insertion of new technologies
	and methods in space hardware has long been a problem due to long
	build times, the desire to use heritage hardware, and lack of effective
	process. The role of momentum in the innovative process can be exploited
	to tackle ongoing technology disruptions and allowing risk interactions
	to be mitigated in a disciplined manner. Examples of how these concepts
	were used during the MBD program will be delineated. Maintaining
	project momentum was essential to assess the constant non recurring
	technological challenges which needed to be retired rapidly from
	the engineering risk liens. Development never slowed due to tactical
	assessment of the hardware with the adoption of the SCRUM technique.
	We adapted this concept as a representation of mitigation of technical
	risk while allowing for design freeze later in the program's development
	cycle. By using Agile Systems Engineering and Management techniques
	which enabled decisive action, the product development momentum effectively
	was used to produce two novel space vehicles in a fraction of time

  abstract = {One of the primary objectives of deploying cognitive radio (CR) within

	rights of incumbent licensed (primary) transmissions are protected
	with respect to interference mitigation when unlicensed (secondary)
	communications are ssimultaneously operating within the same spectral
	vicinity. In this article, we present non-contiguous orthogonal frequency
	division multiplexing (NC-OFDM) as a promising and practical approach
	for achieving spectrally agile wireless data transmission that is
	suitable for secondary users (SUs) to access fragmented spectral
	opportunities more efficiently. Furthermore, a review of the current
	state-of-the-art is conducted with respect to methods specifically
	designed to protect the transmissions of the primary users (PUs)
	from possible interference caused by nearby SU transceivers employing
	NC-OFDM. These methods focus on the suppression of out-of-band (OOB)
	emissions resulting from the use of NC-OFDM transmission. To achieve
	the required OOB suppression, we present two practical approaches
	that can be employed in NC-OFDM, namely, the insertion of cancellation
	carriers and windowing. In addition to the theoretical development
	and proposed improvements of these approaches the computer simulation
	results of their performance are presented. Several real-world scenarios
	regarding the coexistence of both PU and SU signals are also studied
	using actual wireless experiments based on software-defined radio.
	These simulation and experimental results indicate that OOB suppression
	can be achieved under real-world conditions, making NC-OFDM transmission
	a viable option for CR usage in DSA networks.},

	Our objective was to understand the challenges of shared decision-making
	in agile software development teams. Method: We designed a multiple
	case study consisting of four projects in two software product companies
	that recently adopted Scrum. We collected data in semi-structured
	interviews, through participant observations, and from process artifacts.
	Results: We identified three main challenges to shared decision-making
	in agile software development: alignment of strategic product plans
	with iteration plans, allocation of development resources, and performing
	development and maintenance tasks in teams. Conclusion: Agile software
	development requires alignment of decisions on the strategic, tactical,
	and operational levels in order to overcome these challenges. Agile
	development also requires a transition from specialized skills to
	redundancy of functions and from rational to naturalistic decision-making.
	This takes time; the case companies needed from one to two years
	to change from traditional, hierarchical decision-making to shared
	decision-making in software development projects. Crown Copyright

	Our aims are to illustrate the use of an ethnographic approach in
	a case study of agile software development adoption, to discuss the
	methodological challenges involved, and to provide support to others
	who conduct ethnographic studies of software practice. An ethnographic
	case study was conducted, employing participant observation, interviews,
	and document analysis. Difficulties and decisions were recorded and
	compared with those encountered in the literature. Finally, key challenges
	and guidelines to tackle them were discussed and documented. We identified
	five key challenges of applying ethnography to the study of software
	practices: (a) working in collaboration with and having something
	to offer to the participating company; (b) the insider/outsider dynamic
	of participant observation; (c) the balance between participant listening
	and participant observation; (d) the researcher's relationship with
	the participants; and (e) the rigor in qualitative work that involves
	the dilemma of the contextualization to be sufficiently broad and
	detailed. This study shows that ethnographic methods are indispensible
	when trying to understand software practice, and that the fundamental
	challenge for the researcher is to balance the role of participant
	observer with rigorous fieldwork.},

	framework for large scale image processing and analysis over heterogeneous
	computing resources, such as those available in clouds, grids, computer
	clusters or throughout scattered computer resources (desktops, labs)
	in an opportunistic manner. Through BIGS, eScience for image processing
	and analysis is conceived to exploit coarse grained parallelism based
	on data partitioning and parameter sweeps, avoiding the need of inter-process
	communication and, therefore, enabling loosely coupled computing
	nodes (BIGS workers). It adopts an uncommitted resource allocation
	model where (1) experimenters define their image processing pipelines
	in a simple configuration file, (2) a schedule of jobs is generated
	and (3) workers, as they become available, take over pending jobs
	as long as their dependency on other jobs is fulfilled. BIGS workers
	act autonomously, querying the job schedule to determine which one
	to take over. This removes the need for a central scheduling node,
	requiring only access by all workers to a shared information source.
	Furthermore, BIGS workers are encapsulated within different technologies
	to enable their agile deployment over the available computing resources.
	Currently they can be launched through the Amazon EC2 service over
	their cloud resources, through Java Web Start from any desktop computer
	and through regular scripting or SSH commands. This suits well different
	kinds of research environments, both when accessing dedicated computing
	clusters or clouds with committed computing capacity or when using
	opportunistic computing resources whose access is seldom or cannot
	be provisioned in advance. We also adopt a NoSQL storage model to
	ensure the scalability of the shared information sources required
	by all workers, including within BIGS support for HBase and Amazon's
	DynamoDB service. Overall, BIGS now enables researchers to run large
	scale image processing pipelines in an easy, affordable and unplanned
	manner with the capability to take over computing resources as they
	become available at run time. This is shown in this paper by using
	BIGS in different experimental setups in the Amazon cloud and in
	an opportunistic manner, demonstrating its configurability, adaptability
	and scalability capabilities.},

	to be carried out by external experts on the Web. Especially when
	lacking experience or expertise with certain task types, crowdsourcing
	offers a convenient way to receive instant support. In this paper,
	we introduce an in-house enterprise crowdsourcing model, which leverages
	the crowdsourcing concept and transfers it to traditional organizations.
	Here, a company's staff is considered a crowd that - besides its
	regularly assigned tasks can also receive tasks from colleagues from
	other departments and across hierarchical structures. The aim is
	to offer instant support and utilize free capacities throughout a
	large organization more efficiently. In our work, we describe this
	concept and supporting mechanisms in context of an agile software
	development use case. However, in contrast to usually crowdsourced
	microtasks, complex software architectures usually consist of tens
	and hundreds of connected modules that can be potentially crowdsourced.
	These technical dependencies between modules require active coordination
	and interactions between crowd members that process the single artifacts.
	Hence, technical dependencies of artifacts result in social dependencies
	of collaborating crowd members that create them. In order to efficiently
	discover member compositions based on artifact dependencies, we introduce
	an indexing and discovery approach based on subgraph matching. Typically,
	assigning tasks to well-rehearsed teams results in more reliable
	task processing, faster results, and higher quality of work. We evaluate
	our approach in terms of system scalability and overall applicability
	by mining and analyzing the popular SourceForge community. We show
	that our approach of member composition discovery is feasibly in
	terms of scalability and quality of discovery results. Our findings

	levels and is becoming a major public health threat. Lack of efficacious
	antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems was identified as one
	of the causes of increasing resistance, due to the lag time between
	new resistances and alerts to care providers. Several initiatives
	to track drug resistance evolution have been developed. However,
	no effective real-time and source-independent antimicrobial resistance
	monitoring system is available publicly. Objective: To design and
	implement an architecture that can provide real-time and source-independent
	antimicrobial resistance monitoring to support transnational resistance
	surveillance. In particular, we investigated the use of a Semantic
	Web-based model to foster integration and interoperability of interinstitutional
	and cross-border microbiology laboratory databases. Methods: Following
	the agile software development methodology, we derived the main requirements
	needed for effective antimicrobial resistance monitoring, from which
	we proposed a decentralized monitoring architecture based on the
	Semantic Web stack. The architecture uses an ontology-driven approach
	to promote the integration of a network of sentinel hospitals or
	laboratories. Local databases are wrapped into semantic data repositories
	that automatically expose local computing-formalized laboratory information
	in the Web. A central source mediator, based on local reasoning,
	coordinates the access to the semantic end points. On the user side,
	a user-friendly Web interface provides access and graphical visualization
	to the integrated views. Results: We designed and implemented the
	online Antimicrobial Resistance Trend Monitoring System (ARTEMIS)
	in a pilot network of seven European health care institutions sharing
	70+ million triples of information about drug resistance and consumption.
	Evaluation of the computing performance of the mediator demonstrated
	that, on average, query response time was a few seconds (mean 4.3,
	SD 0.1x10(2) seconds). Clinical pertinence assessment showed that
	resistance trends automatically calculated by ARTEMIS had a strong
	positive correlation with the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance
	Network (EARS-Net) (rho = .86, P < .001) and the Sentinel Surveillance
	of Antibiotic Resistance in Switzerland (SEARCH) (rho = .84, P <
	.001) systems. Furthermore, mean resistance rates extracted by ARTEMIS
	were not significantly different from those of either EARS-Net (Delta
	= +/- 0.130; 95\% confidence interval -0 to 0.030; P < .001) or SEARCH
	(Delta = +/- 0.042; 95\% confidence interval -0.004 to 0.028; P =
	.004). Conclusions: We introduce a distributed monitoring architecture
	that can be used to build transnational antimicrobial resistance
	surveillance networks. Results indicated that the Semantic Web-based
	approach provided an efficient and reliable solution for development
	of eHealth architectures that enable online antimicrobial resistance
	monitoring from heterogeneous data sources. In future, we expect
	that more health care institutions can join the ARTEMIS network so
	that it can provide a large European and wider biosurveillance network
	that can be used to detect emerging bacterial resistance in a multinational
	context and support public health actions.},

  abstract = {Context: Agile software development with its emphasis on producing
	working code through frequent releases, extensive client interactions
	and iterative development has emerged as an alternative to traditional
	plan-based software development methods. While a number of case studies
	have provided insights into the use and consequences of agile, few
	empirical studies have examined the factors that drive the adoption
	and use of agile. Objective: We draw on intention-based theories
	and a dialectic perspective to identify factors driving the use of
	agile practices among adopters of this software development methodology.
	Method: Data for the study was gathered through an anonymous online
	survey of software development professionals. We requested participation
	from members of a selected list of online discussion groups, and
	received 98 responses. Results: Our analyses reveal that subjective
	norm and training play a significant role in influencing software
	developers' use of agile processes and methods, while perceived benefits
	and perceived limitations are not primary drivers of agile use among
	adopters. Interestingly, perceived benefit emerges as a significant
	predictor of agile use only if adopters face hindrances to their
	agile practices. Conclusion: We conclude that research in the adoption
	of software development innovations should examine the effects of
	both enabling and detracting factors and the interactions between
	them. Since training, subjective norm, and the interplay between
	perceived benefits and perceived hindrances appear to be key factors
	influencing the adoption of agile methods, researchers can focus
	on how to (a) perform training on agile methods more effectively,
	(b) facilitate the dialog between developers and managers about perceived
	benefits and hindrances, and (c) capitalize on subjective norm to
	publicize the benefits of agile methods within an organization. Further,
	when managing the transition to new software development methods,
	we recommend that practitioners adapt their strategies and tactics
	contingent on the extent of perceived hindrances to the change. (C)

  abstract = {Agile method use in information systems development (ISD) has grown

	approaches was very much industry-led at the outset, and while agile
	method research is growing, the vast majority of these studies are
	descriptive and often lack a strong theoretical and conceptual base.
	Insights from innovation adoption research can provide a new perspective
	on analysing agile method use. This paper is based on an exploratory
	study of the application of the innovation assimilation stages to
	understand the use of agile practices, focusing in particular on
	the later stages of assimilation, namely acceptance, routinisation
	and infusion. Four case studies were conducted, and based on the
	case study findings, the concepts of acceptance, routinisation and
	infusion were adapted and applied to agile software development.
	These adapted concepts were used to glean interesting insights into
	agile practice use. For example, it was shown that the period of
	use of agile practices does not have a proportional effect on their
	assimilation depths. We also reflected on the sequential assumption
	underlying the assimilation stages, showing that adopting teams do
	not always move through the assimilation stages in a linear manner.},

  abstract = {Today's software development has become a complex task and no one
	has the required skills or time to solve a sophisticated problem
	on his own. Software development needs the involvement of different
	roles and people having to use concepts and ideas for which they
	need to share a common understanding. In such a context, several
	software development methodologies have appeared in the last thirty
	years. Those methodologies use different development life cycles,
	one of the most famous being the iterative one notably used by the
	Unified Process (UP) and agile methods. To teach software project
	managers and computer science students the required skills to deal
	with such development processes few approaches exist. Indeed, nowadays
	one mostly learns from ex-cathedra courses and books or on an empirical
	basis when involved into `real life' projects. Both learning approaches
	have major flaws since `theory-only' fails to highlight the practical
	dimension and empirical learning exposes the organization to damageable
	mistakes. e-SPM is an online multi-users game simulating the tasks
	of a software project manager facing user requirements, development
	planning, human resources allocation, budget constraints, risk and
	quality management within a UP/UML project in the steel industry.
	The originality of the game resides in its design based on the documentation
	and experience of previously performed real-life projects. The game
	mainly focuses on hard (technical) skills for project managers but
	also introduces random events showing to the player which soft skills
	are required in practice; it has been validated using the competencies
