abstract={Most modern companies realize that the best way to improve stability in the global, rapidly changing world is to be innovating and produce software that will be fully used and appreciated by customers. The key aspect on this road is personnel and processes. One of the best approaches to software development process into follow modern agility techniques. Unfortunately sometimes requirements to execute such are too high although the benefits are also sufficient. The paper proposes that the relaxing of those restrictions in many key aspects formulated as semi-agile technique can improve the level of possible adoption of it without any decrease of acquired benefits. The approach sufficiently differs from the hybrid agile proposals. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media.},

abstract={Agile software development is well-known for its focus on close customer collaboration and customer feedback. In emphasizing flexibility, efficiency and speed, agile practices have lead to a paradigm shift in how software is developed. However, while agile practices have succeeded in involving the customer in the development cycle, there is an urgent need to learn from customer usage of software also after delivering and deployment of the software product. The concept of continuous deployment, i.e. the ability to deliver software functionality frequently to customers and subsequently, the ability to continuously learn from real-time customer usage of software, has become attractive to companies realizing the potential in having even shorter feedback loops. However, the transition towards continuous deployment involves a number of barriers. This paper presents a multiple-case study in which we explore barriers associated with the transition towards continuous deployment. Based on interviews at four different software development companies we present key barriers in this transition as well as actions that need to be taken to address these. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In the application's development described in NCL language, we have observed the reuse of some models and document structures, which is possible by repetition of common codes on applications. Thus, we do visualize the need to generalize this kind of development described in NCL. This need has been observed by other developers who are aiming at the possibility of the reuse of structure from some documents. This paper introduces Luar, an authoring language for NCL templates. The Luar language has been conceived through analysis of the applications' behavior for iDTV. Luar has a templates's processor developed with the Lua language and library to maintain and to aggregating template collections, sharing them among developers. The entire template system aims to facilitate the design and development of interactive applications described in NCL using the technique of reuse.

abstract={Code reviews are an integral part of the development of a dependable system such as for airport operations. It is commonly accepted that code reviews are an effective quality assurance technique even if a rigorous application is also a high cost factor. For large software systems a formal method may be inapplicable throughout the whole codebase. In this study an airport operational database (AODB) is developed with the application of a more lightweight approach to code reviews. A continuous, distributed and change-based process is applied by the development team and evaluated in comparison to team walkthroughs (IEEE-1028) as a baseline method. The application showed to be highly useful, equally effective as the baseline, but more efficient especially for the preparation, execution and rework effort. The results show that continuous code reviews also support the understanding of the codebase and the concept of collective ownership. Such processes may not completely substitute a more formal and effortful technique. Especially for reviewing critical design aspects or complex items a traditional approach is still more appropriate. The main outcome is that such lightweight code reviews may be used together with more formal approaches to ensure a high coverage and that the degree of formalism should be adopted to the criticality of the item under review. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we detail findings about the use of Scrum-a widely adopted agile software development framework-among a student game development team. Looking closely at six weeks of Scrum practices from a larger fifteen-week ethnography, we describe how Scrum strongly mediates everyday actions for the thirteen participants we studied. In analyzing our data, we deployed activity theory in concert with genre theory to better understand how participants repeatedly articulated and coarticulated finite, goal-directed, individual actions in the service of a broader, ongoing, shared objective. We offer, therefore, a way of understanding the Scrum process framework as a powerful orienting genre that facilitates collective development practice by stabilizing and intermediating a host of related, dynamic genres and artifacts.

abstract={Educational games are essential in the next generation of e-learning tools because games stress visual and experiential learning; they require active involvement by student players while providing almost instantaneous feedback. The long term goal of this research project is to define a model-driven game engineering approach, SimSYS, that supports the rapid development of serious educational games across diverse educational topics. Here, we present our approach for modeling serious educational games, using tailored UML use cases (visual UML diagram and detailed tabular specifications). The tailored approach integrates features of storyboarding techniques (well-established in the game community), with use case modeling (well-established in the software engineering community). The use case model can be transformed into a formal XML representation that can be loaded by the SimSYS Game Play Engine. Part of a game on agile software development process is used for illustration. © 2012 IEEE.},

The transition is making progress, and you are seeing improvements at all levels but you cannot help feeling that you've lost an understanding of the key decisions that the organization needs to make. You still have to run the business, to make commitments, and to release products. In the past you had information from the product teams that allowed you to understand where the issues were. That information seems to have disappeared. When you ask for it, you are given a "release burn-up chart" and are told that "Scrum means we respond to change" and "we don't do big upfront planning any more." How can you get what you need and still be "Scrum", still be "agile"? © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Agile methods provide an organization or a team with the flexibility to adopt a selected subset of principles and practices based on their culture, their values, and the types of systems that they develop. More specifically, every organization or team implements a customized agile method, tailored to better accommodate its needs. However, the extent to which a customized method supports the organizational objectives, i.e. the 'goodness' of that method, is questionable. Existing agile assessment approaches focus on comparative analyses, or are limited in scope and application. In this research, we propose a structured, systematic, and comprehensive approach to assessing the 'goodness' of agile methods. We examine an agile method based on (1) its adequacy, (2) the capability of the organization to support the adopted principles and practices specified by the method, and (3) the method's effectiveness. We propose the Objectives, Principles and Practices (OPP) Framework to guide our assessment. The Framework identifies (1) objectives of the agile philosophy, (2) principles that support the objectives, (3) practices that are reflective of the principles, (4) linkages among the objectives, principles and practices, and (5) indicators for assessing the extent to which an organization supports the implementation and the effectiveness of that practice. In this paper, we discuss our solution approach, preliminary results, and future work. © 2012 IEEE.},

The analysis is based on documentation analysis and semi-structured interviews of seven software development professionals. The results show that there were difficulties integrating UX design and software engineering work in an agile and iterative manner. The transition process succeeded in shifting UX and related documentation to a central planning role. The roles of the UX designers in the teams were still under re-definition. There was also a clear need to establish new ways of collaboration between UX professionals and software designers. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Agile software development methods (ASD) and open source software development methods (OSSD) are two different approaches which were introduced in last decade and both of them have their fanatical advocators. Yet, it seems that relation and interface between ASD and OSSD is a fertile area and few rigorous studies have been done in this matter. Major goal of this study was assessment of the relation and integration of ASD and OSSD. Analyzing of collected data shows that ASD and OSSD are able to support each other. Some practices in one of them are useful in the other. Another finding is that however there are some case studies using ASD and OSSD simultaneously, but there is not enough evidence about comprehensive integration of them. © 2012 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.},

abstract={The efficient cooperation of Web services is essential to applications of a Virtual Organization (VO). However, lots of challenges result from the diversity of services and the variability of business requirements. A novel approach to service cooperation based on Agile Services is proposed. The model of Agile Service is realized based on Tree Syntax. Aiming at mismatches of services existing in the cooperation, a set of operators for automatic service adaptation is also introduced. To verify the availability and efficiency of the approach to service cooperation, a real scenario and some Web services in the domain of Bioinformatics are taken. Application and experiments indicate that the proposed approach is efficient to realize more agile cooperation in a dynamic and heterogeneous services environment. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Many software-development organizations have recently started to adopt agile practices in order to benefit from the improvements they clearly bring, in terms of production speed and software quality, for example. However, in a large, distributed organization, such as Nokia Siemens Networks, an agile transformation may be a long-term, complex process, and therefore, evaluating the benefits achieved, and measuring the success of the change, can be difficult, especially in the early phases of the transformation. This paper is based on the results of a case study on the impact introducing agile practices actually had in a large, software-development organization, part of Nokia Siemens Networks. The impact of this agile transformation was evaluated in terms of how well it succeeded in achieving the goals set by the management before the transformation started. This longitudinal study included two separate analyses, made at 6 monthly intervals, which measured what agile practices were really in use in the organization, and what effects, if any, were visible in terms of the goals which had been set by the management The 6 monthly analyses included defect data metrics and opinion surveys of the personnel directly involved in the transformation. The study showed two things: firstly, that the introduction of agile practices does have the beneficial effects that one would expect, and secondly, that, using this kind of study, it is not only possible to evaluate the impact that the adoption of agile practices has in a large, established software-development company, but also that the effects are visible at a surprisingly early stage. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Agile method use in information systems development (ISD) has grown dramatically in recent years. The emergence of these alternative approaches was very much industry-led at the outset, and while agile method research is growing, the vast majority of these studies are descriptive and often lack a strong theoretical and conceptual base. Insights from innovation adoption research can provide a new perspective on analysing agile method use. This paper is based on an exploratory study of the application of the innovation assimilation stages to understand the use of agile practices, focusing in particular on the later stages of assimilation, namely acceptance, routinisation and infusion. Four case studies were conducted, and based on the case study findings, the concepts of acceptance, routinisation and infusion were adapted and applied to agile software development. These adapted concepts were used to glean interesting insights into agile practice use. For example, it was shown that the period of use of agile practices does not have a proportional effect on their assimilation depths. We also reflected on the sequential assumption underlying the assimilation stages, showing that adopting teams do not always move through the assimilation stages in a linear manner. © 2012 Wiley Publishing Ltd.},

The technique that is most frequently used is lo-fi prototyping used by more than half of the participants two to four times a month. All these usability techniques are informal, meaning that these techniques can be used quickly without much preparation. Formal usability evaluation with users is a highly ranked technique by the participants but not commonly used by them. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

As the emphasis of user experience work has inherently been on the early phases before starting the development, it also needs to be adapted to the Agile way of working. To improve the current practices in Agile user experience work, we determined the present state of a multi-continental software development organization that already had a functioning user experience team. In this paper, we describe the most prevalent issues regarding the interaction of user experience design and software development activities, and suggest improvements to fix those. Most of the observed problems were related to communication issues and to the service mode of the user experience team. The user experience team was operating between management and development organizations trying to adapt to the dissimilar practices of both the disciplines. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

Test is one of the discipline of Rational Unified Process (RUP) among its nine disciplines where testing is performed in all four phases of RUP. In Construction phase the component are tested separately and then move to Transition phase, where beta testing take place. Testing an individual object is a time consuming approach of Rational Unified Process. The concept of group testing is introduced as a sub-discipline of test discipline. In proposed approach a group of similar components are tested together in group form to minimize the testing time.

abstract={Usability practitioners conduct formative evaluations, such as heuristic evaluations and thinking aloud tests, to identify potential problems in a user interface as part of the iterative design cycle. The findings of a formative evaluation (in essence, a list of potential problems) are usually compiled into written reports and typically delivered as a PDF or Word document. A written report is convenient for reading, but makes it difficult to reuse the findings electronically. The usability markup language (UsabML) defines a structured reporting format for the results of usability evaluations. In agile software development the direct handover of usability findings to software engineers can speed up development cycles and improve software quality. Usability managers can now enter the findings of formative evaluations into a new, web-based system called Usability Reporting Manager (URM). Findings can be exported in UsabML format, which in turn can easily be imported by software engineers into an issue-tracking system connected to a source code repository. UsabML can also be transformed into other formats such as HTML and PDF via stylesheets (XSL). © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

However, how to implement it in projects with tens of teams is not explained. In this paper, we present a multiple case study on how Scrum-of-Scrum meetings were applied in two large-scale, globally distributed Scrum projects both employing at least twenty Scrum teams. We conducted 58 semi-structured interviews of project personnel, including managers, architects, product owners, developers and testers. Our results show that Scrum-of-Scrum meetings involving representatives from all teams were severely challenged: the audience was too wide to keep everybody interested and the participants did not know what to report that might be valuable to other teams, often ending up not reporting anything. As a solution, one of the case projects introduced feature-specific Scrum-of- Scrums meetings for 3-5 teams working on the same feature, which turned out to work well. However, challenges with coordination at the project level remained. The other case organization tried a sitebased SoS structure that still did not work well. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Earlier empirical studies have demonstrated the interest that agile methods have generated in the software industry. Currently, lean approaches are increasingly adopted for complementing agile methods in software processes. With the goal of providing up-today results that can be used by organizations implementing or planning to implement agile and/or lean methods, we have conducted a study on the current stage of agile and lean adoption and usage in the software industry. For this purpose, we conducted an extensive survey among Finnish software practitioners in 2011, using the membership registry of The Finnish Information Processing Association (FIPA) as a sampling frame. 408 responses were collected from 200 software intensive organizations in the study. The survey included questions for identifying the rate of agile and lean usage in software organizations as well as the implementation of specific methods and practices, goals in adopting agile and lean, reasons for not applying these methods and effects of the agile and lean usage. The results of the survey reveal that a majority of respondents' organizational units are using agile and/or lean methods (58%). Furthermore, lean appears as a new player, being used by 24% of respondents, mainly in combination with agile (21%). The reasons and benefits for using agile and lean methods appeared to correspond in most parts to the findings of the earlier research. Generally, the experiences of using agile and lean methods seem to be rather positive, although challenges, such as obtaining management support and limitations for scaling agile in distributed settings, were also identified.

abstract={Ethnography is about the adoption of a cultural lens to observe and interpret events, actions, and behaviors, ensuring that they are placed in a relevant and meaningful context. Using this approach, it is possible to capture and analyze software development practices. Our aims are to illustrate the use of an ethnographic approach in a case study of agile software development adoption, to discuss the methodological challenges involved, and to provide support to others who conduct ethnographic studies of software practice. An ethnographic case study was conducted, employing participant observation, interviews, and document analysis. Difficulties and decisions were recorded and compared with those encountered in the literature. Finally, key challenges and guidelines to tackle them were discussed and documented. We identified five key challenges of applying ethnography to the study of software practices: (a) working in collaboration with and having something to offer to the participating company; (b) the insider/outsider dynamic of participant observation; (c) the balance between participant listening and participant observation; (d) the researcher's relationship with the participants; and (e) the rigor in qualitative work that involves the dilemma of the contextualization to be sufficiently broad and detailed. This study shows that ethnographic methods are indispensible when trying to understand software practice, and that the fundamental challenge for the researcher is to balance the role of participant observer with rigorous fieldwork.

The key was to build the foundation on the common best practice of 'feature- orientation' present in flavors in both disciplines. Featureorientation allowed merging both disciplines into a holistic approach that blends the benefits of product line engineering with those of Agility .- resulting in improved product delivery, as well as employee and customer satisfaction.

abstract={This paper summarizes our experience with introducing feature modeling into a product line for imaging and therapy systems in the Siemens Healthcare Sector. Determining and negotiating the scope in a product line that spans several business units with their own economic goals is challenging. Feature modeling offers a good way to do variability/commonality analysis for complex product lines. A precondition for feature modeling is the identification of all features supporting the product line. To identify these features, we developed a method for systematically deriving a feature model top down based on domain know-how. We call this method domain specific feature modeling. As the primary artifact to describe the problem space, a domain specific feature model additionally improves the requirement understanding for all stakeholders by considerably improving the scoping, traceability, testing, efficiency and transparency of planning activities and making the development efforts easier to estimate. In this paper, we share our experience with domain specific feature modeling in a large platform project and describe the lessons learned. We describe our general approach that can also be used for other domains. Copyright © 2012 ACM.},

Many organisations use traditional approaches, such as the Waterfall model, to develop software products for different customers. Agile software development has departed from traditional approaches, such as the Waterfall model. Much research has been conducted on adopting agile software development for either distributed or collocated projects. However, little research has discussed organisational boundaries between developers who use an agile software development approach and their customers. The purpose of this paper is to introduce agile software development to those organisations that develop software products for different distributed customers and also to study the potential impact of introducing Agile development across those organisational boundaries. We proposed a framework for developing software across organisational boundaries. This would ultimately address and accommodate key factors in software development across organisational boundaries using an agile development approach. This research will help the development society and serve as a guide for project managers, developers, stakeholders, and users to understand agile software development and the impact of adopting an Agile approach across organisational and cultural boundaries in their projects. © 2012 Infonomics Society.},

Compared to traditional licensed software and software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications, Webponder is particularly suitable for building those community-based applications that are ad hoc and/or ever-evolving in nature, and often need fast development and agile update. Webponder provides a cost-effective alternative, in terms of cost and time-to-market, to the provisioning of these applications. In addition, Webponder is easy to be adopted and integrated with other enterprise applications or Cloud services as it is based upon open standards and provides a Web service interface. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Objective: By means of animal study, investigated the gut barrier function in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), and role of inflammatory factors releasing, gut mucosa oxidative stress, cell apoptosis in it. Methods: The animal experiment was done in the animal center of first people' s hospital, shanghai jiaotong university. Twenty four BALB/c mice were randomized (random number) divided into two groups with twelve mice each group. The SAP group, mice received six intraperitoneal injections of cerulein at 1-hour intervals, the dose was 50p,g/kg, then given one intraperitoneal injection of 10 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS from E. Coli) for the induction of severe acute pancreatitis. The control (sham operation) group, the mice received intraperitoneal injection of 2 ml normal saline for six times at 1-hour intervals. All the animals of each group were averaged to two batches, 4 h and 8h after being operated respectively, to be anesthetized and adopted blood and tissue specimen. Then we observed the pathological change of pancreas and gut, scored it. We measured the blood value of diamine oxidase (DAO), amylase and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). We detected content of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) and activity of xanthine oxidase (XO) in gut mucosa. We detected the casepase-3 activity and cell apopotosis by means of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) in gut mucosa, and conculated the apopotosis index (AI). Then using the PASW 18. 0 software, we analyzed the data by anova and t-test, to make sure if the values were statistically different between the two groups and the mechanism of gut barrier dysfunction in panreatitis. Results: At 4 h and 8 h after operation, the SAP-group-mice had significantly higher pancreas pathological score (P < 0. 01), blood amylase value (P <0. 05), gut pathological score and blood DAO and TNF-α value (P < 0. 01), compared with the contral-group-mice. The gut mucosa MDA content and XO activity of mice in SAP group were significantly higher than which in control group (P < 0.01). The SAP-group-mice had significantly lower gut mucosa SOD content (P <0. 01) and GSH content (P <0. 05), compared with the contral-group-mice. The gut mucosa cells of mice in SAP group had significantly higher caspase-3 activity and apoptosis index than which in control group (P <0. 01). Conclusions In severe acute pancreatitis, inflammatory factors such as TNF-awere waterfall-style released, induced gut mucosa suffer from ischemia-reperfusion injury, then serious oxidative stress developed in mucosa and activated caspase-3 pathway, inducing gut mucosa cells apoptose seriously, which was an important mechanism of gut barrier dysfunction.},

abstract={Invariants are constraints on software components which restrict their behavior in some desirable way, but whose maintenance entails some kind of proof obligation discharge. Such constraints may act not only over the input and output domains, as in a purely functional setting, but also over the underlying state space, as in the case of reactive components. This talk introduces an approach for reasoning about invariants which is both compositional and calculational: compositional because it is based on rules which break the complexity of such proof obligations across the structures involved; calculational because such rules are derived thanks to an algebra of invariants encoded in the language of binary relations. A main tool of this approach is the pointfree transform of the predicate calculus, which opens the possibility of changing the underlying mathematical space so as to enable agile algebraic calculation. The development of a theory of invariant preservation requires a broad, but uniform view of computational processes embodied in software components able to take into account data persistence and continued interaction. Such is the plan for this talk: we first introduce such processes as arrows, and then invariants as their types. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Agile methods have been increasingly adopted to make data warehouse design faster and nimbler. They divide a data warehouse project into sprints (iterations), and include a sprint planning phase that is critical to ensure the project success. Several factors impact on the optimality of a sprint plan, e.g., the estimated complexity, business value, and affinity of the elemental functionalities included in each sprint, which makes the planning problem difficult. In this paper we formalize the planning problem and propose an optimization model that, given the estimates made by the project team and a set of development constraints, produces an optimal sprint plan that maximizes the business value perceived by users. The planning problem is converted into a multi-knapsack problem with constraints, given a linear programming formulation, and solved using the IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimizer. Finally, the proposed approach is validated through effectiveness and efficiency tests. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Business Intelligence (BI) solutions require the design and implementation of complex processes (denoted ETL) that extract, transform, and load data from the sources to a common repository. New applications, like for example, real-time data warehousing, require agile and flexible tools that allow BI users to take timely decisions based on extremely up-to-date data. This calls for new ETL tools able to adapt to constant changes and quickly produce and modify executable code. A way to achieve this is to make ETL processes become aware of the business processes in the organization, in order to easily identify which data are required, and when and how to load them in the data warehouse. Therefore, we propose to model ETL processes using the standard representation mechanism denoted BPMN (Business Process Modeling and Notation). In this paper we present a BPMN-based metamodel for conceptual modeling of ETL processes. This metamodel is based on a classification of ETL objects resulting from a study of the most used commercial and open source ETL tools. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={This paper presents a customization of the Rational Unified Process (RUP) in a systems integration scenario in a large telecommunication company. The purpose of congregating existing systems is to leverage greater benefits from the company's computer systems. RUP has been chosen as the software development process due to its strong focus on promoting the fulfillment of the needs of end-users, while all along increasing chances that the process be delivered within an estimated schedule and budget. However, despite the undisputed interest in RUP, there is a gap in the total amount of empirical studies on the adoption and introduction of RUP in the context of specific project types. Moreover, there is little research in investigating and adopting RUP in system integration scenarios. In this paper we investigate the right process-level of RUP to be applied to the systems integration project in a real world business scenario. In addition we evaluate the suitability of RUP for this project's context. Evaluation results present advantages and disadvantages of using RUP in projects of the type described here while areas of future work are identified and presented. © 2012 Crown Copyright.},

abstract={In a short period of time, the World Wide Web has had a huge impact on our society and lives. In web sites and web applications, accessibility and usability are essential key requirements. Unfortunately, most web sites are inaccessible to many disabled people and fail to satisfy the most basic standards for accessibility. Many of the barriers people with disabilities face on the Web are completely avoidable and the disadvantage associated with disability can be entirely overcome. To support the accessibility of web sites, different accessibility guidelines and standards have been introduced for the last ten years. Nevertheless, a web site can meet accessibility standards, but it can still difficult for people with disabilities to use it. Moreover, web accessibility has been often an afterthought in the development process of web sites. In many cases, web developers provide an adaptation or a fix to the interface of a web site after it has been released to the public. In this paper, we argue that the adoption of agile software development methods can help to improve the accessibility of web projects. Besides, the integration of accessibility into agile methods is proposed.},

abstract={Context: Agile software development changes the nature of collaboration, coordination, and communication in software projects. Objective: Our objective was to understand the challenges of shared decision-making in agile software development teams. Method: We designed a multiple case study consisting of four projects in two software product companies that recently adopted Scrum. We collected data in semi-structured interviews, through participant observations, and from process artifacts. Results: We identified three main challenges to shared decision-making in agile software development: alignment of strategic product plans with iteration plans, allocation of development resources, and performing development and maintenance tasks in teams. Conclusion: Agile software development requires alignment of decisions on the strategic, tactical, and operational levels in order to overcome these challenges. Agile development also requires a transition from specialized skills to redundancy of functions and from rational to naturalistic decision-making. This takes time; the case companies needed from one to two years to change from traditional, hierarchical decision-making to shared decision-making in software development projects. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Context: While there are many success stories of achieving high reuse and improved quality using software platforms, there is a need to investigate the issues and challenges organizations face when transitioning to a software platform strategy. Objective: This case study provides a comprehensive taxonomy of the challenges faced when a medium-scale organization decided to adopt software platforms. The study also reveals how new trends in software engineering (i.e. agile methods, distributed development, and flat management structures) interplayed with the chosen platform strategy. Method: We used an ethnographic approach to collect data by spending time at a medium-scale company in Scandinavia. We conducted 16 in-depth interviews with representatives of eight different teams, three of which were working on three separate platforms. The collected data was analyzed using Grounded Theory. Results: The findings identify four classes of challenges, namely: business challenges, organizational challenges, technical challenges, and people challenges. The article explains how these findings can be used to help researchers and practitioners identify practical solutions and required tool support. Conclusion: The organization's decision to adopt a software platform strategy introduced a number of challenges. These challenges need to be understood and addressed in order to reap the benefits of reuse. Researchers need to further investigate issues such as supportive organizational structures for platform development, the role of agile methods in software platforms, tool support for testing and continuous integration in the platform context, and reuse recommendation systems. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={From the March/Micra released in 2002 to the LEAF EV today, on-board electronic systems have come to possess bigger software programs and more complexity in the transition to distributed high-speed ECU network systems. Meanwhile, faster time-to-market requirements have shortened the development period. If a conventional development process like the waterfall model is applied to develop a distributed ECU network system, numerous problems may occur at the vehicle testing stage that requires a lot of rework. To avoid that, we devised a new development methodology of distributed ECU systems and implemented it in our vehicle function development programs to improve development work quality across the entire spectrum of vehicle electronics. This development methodology consists of two principal elements. One is an Electronic Integration Platform (EIPF) and the other one is a Design-EIPF (D-EIPF). EIPF is a system-testing environment for actual vehicle parts and D-EIPF is a system evaluation environment for virtual vehicle parts. Both of them are based on Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) and use Model Based Development (MBD) simulation technologies. First, in the design phase, we create simulation models from the control specifications using Statemate and/or Simulink/Stateflow and run simulations to check the behavior of individual ECUs alone. Second, we create the D-EIPF environment composed of the ECU models and communication network models. The latter models run on CANoe using multiplex communication and an in-house tool for the harness connections. D-EIPF enables system-level testing as well as customer aspect testing at an early phase before EIPF tests and in-vehicle testing using actual parts. This means that we can validate system-level functions before building any bench test system or prototype vehicle. In addition, D-EIPF and EIPF use a common test suite that can run the same test scenarios between them, which improves traceability and development work efficiency. This paper gives a general description of the life cycle process using the EIPF and D-EIPF system, which is a symmetrical process for obtaining strong solutions. © 2012 SAE International.},

abstract={In this paper, we introduce e 3alignment for inter-organizational business-ICT alignment. With the e 3alignment framework, we create alignment between organizations operating in an agile networked value constellation-which is a set of organizations who jointly satisfy a customer need-by (1) focusing on the interaction between the organizations in the constellation, (2) considering interaction from four different perspectives, and (3) utilizing conceptual modeling techniques to analyze and create alignment within and between the perspectives. By creating inter-organizational business-ICT alignment between the actors in the constellation, e 3alignment ultimately contributes to a sustainable and profitable constellation. To actually create alignment, e 3alignment iteratively takes three specific steps: (1) identification of alignment issues, (2) solution design, and (3) impact analysis. We illustrate our approach with cases from the Dutch aviation industry, Spanish electricity industry, and Dutch telecom industry. © 2011 The Author(s).},

abstract={Web applications are hard to build not only because of technical reasons but also because they involve many different kinds of stakeholders. Involving customers in the development process is a must, not only while eliciting requirements but also considering that requirements change fast and they must be validated continuously. However, while model-driven approaches represent a step forward to reduce development time and work at a higher level of abstraction, most of them practically ignore stakeholders' involvement. Agile approaches tend to solve this problem, though they generally focus on programming rather than modeling. In this paper we present an extension to an approach that combines the best of both worlds, allowing a formal and high-level design style with constant involvement of customers, mainly in the definition of navigation, interaction and interface features. We extended it by adding transformation features that allow mapping requirement models into content and navigation ones. We provide a proof of concept in the context of the WebML design method and an empiric validation of the approach's advantages. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={In 2011, an experiment was undertaken at KTH Royal Institute of Technology to introduce agile methods for product development into a mechatronics capstone course. This paper describes the method used, Scrum, and the context of the studied mechatronics capstone course. Mechatronics is here defined as "synergistic integration" of electronics, mechanical engineering, control and software engineering. Mechatronics product development, in this context, therefore deals with the development of complex and intelligent products, which implies multi-disciplinary work and the use of models etc. from several domains and areas. With the integration of Scrum into the mechatronics capstone course, an educational favorable alternative is identified, to previously used design methodologies such as more traditional stage-gate methods as the Waterfall or method or the V-model. This is due to the emphasis on early prototyping, quick feedback and incremental development. It still might not be the favorable method for use in large scale industrial development projects where formal procedures might still be preferred, but the pedagogical advantages in mechatronics education are valuable. Incremental development and rapid prototyping for example gives many opportunities to reflect and improve. The Scrum focus on self-organizing teams also provides a platform to practice project organization, by empowering students to take responsibility for the product development process. Among the results of this study, it is shown that it is possible and favorable to integrate Scrum in a mechatronics capstone course and that this can enhance student preparation for a future career as mechatronics product developers. It is also shown that this prepares the students with a larger flexibility to handle the increased complexity in mechatronics product development and thereby enabling the project teams to deliver results faster, more reliable and with higher quality. © 2012 American Society for Engineering Education.},

abstract={As electronic systems are pervading our lives, MPSoC (multiprocessor system-on-chip) security is becoming an important requirement. MPSoCs are able to support multiple applications on the same chip. The challenge is to provide MPSoC security that makes possible a trustworthy system that meets the performance and security requirements of all the applications. The network-on-chip (NoC) can be used to efficiently incorporate security. Our work proposes the implementation of QoSS (quality of security service) to overcome present MPSoC vulnerabilities. QoSS is a novel concept for data protection that introduces security as a dimension of QoS. QoSS takes advantage of the NoC wide system visibility and critical role in enabling system operation, exploiting the NoC components to detect and prevent a wide range of attacks. In this paper, we present the implementation of a layered dynamic security NoC architecture that integrates agile and dynamic security firewalls in order to detect attacks based on different security rules. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach over several MPSoCs scenarios and estimate their impact on the overall performance. We show that our architecture can perform a fast detection of a wide range of attacks and a fast configuration of different security policies for several MPSoC applications.

abstract={The development of collaborative service ecosystem relies mostly on software services spanning multiple organisations in order to provide agile support for business applications. By moving part of their information system on Cloud infrastructure, companies take advantage of new Business models and scalable environments, increasing IT productivity while reducing IS management costs. Nevertheless, this underlying outsourcing strategy may be braked by a lack of security and trust on this new infrastructure model as traditional security engineering and deployment methods are not designed for such an agile and opened environment. To overcome this limit, we propose a multi-dimensional model integrating both the cloud level (XaaS) and the cloud characteristics (Private, public, hybrid) to generate convenient security policy in a dynamic way. Based on security patterns, our multi-dimensional solution has been implemented to capture security requirements related to both information system design and runtime environment.},

abstract={Refactoring is the process of applying behavior-preserving transformations to a program with the objective of improving the program's design. A specific refactoring is identified by a name (e.g., Extract Method), a set of preconditions, and a set of specific transformations that need to be performed. Tool support for refactoring is highly desirable because checking the preconditions for a given refactoring often requires nontrivial program analysis, and applying the transformations may affect many locations throughout a program. In recent years, the emergence of light-weight programming methodologies such as Extreme Programming has generated a great amount of interest in refactoring, and refactoring support has become a required feature in modern-day IDEs. This workshop is a continuation of a series of previous workshops (ECOOP 2007, OOPSLA 2008 and 2009, ICSE 2011 - see http://refactoring.info/WRT) where researchers and developers of refactoring tools can meet and discuss recent ideas and work, and view tool demonstrations.

From a social point of view, understanding social structures in Service-Oriented software engineering can lead to better software (as phrased in Conway's law). From a sustainable point of view, notational, methodological and techological support for Service-Oriented software engineering should aim at retaining past investments (in e.g. legacies), simplifying development processes and addressing global problems like the increasing need for remote collaboration, and the increasing scarcity of energy resources hence demanding for energy efficient solutions. In the S-Cube project the research group adopted a Model-Driven approach to support the communication about, and engineering of, Service-Oriented software. Models, views and viewpoints have been defined to support three main research problems in Service-Oriented software engineering: How to guide migration of legacy assets to services?

abstract={We present a high fidelity cognitive radio (CR) network emulation platform for wireless system tests, measure- ments, and validation. This versatile platform provides the configurable functionalities to control and repeat realistic physical channel effects in integrated space, air, and ground networks. We combine the advantages of scalable simulation environment with reliable hardware performance for high fidelity and repeatable evaluation of heterogeneous CR networks. This approach extends CR design only at device (software-defined-radio) or lower-level protocol (dynamic spectrum access) level to end-to-end cognitive networking, and facilitates low-cost deployment, development, and experimentation of new wireless network protocols and applications on frequency- agile programmable radios. Going beyond the channel emulator paradigm for point-to-point communications, we can support simultaneous transmissions by network-level emulation that allows realistic physical-layer inter- actions between diverse user classes, including secondary users, primary users, and adversarial jammers in CR networks. In particular, we can replay field tests in a lab environment with real radios perceiving and learning the dynamic environment thereby adapting for end-to-end goals over distributed spectrum coordination channels that replace the common control channel as a single point of failure. CR networks offer several dimensions of tunable actions including channel, power, rate, and route selection. The proposed network evaluation platform is fully programmable and can reliably evaluate the necessary cross-layer design solutions with configurable op- timization space by leveraging the hardware experiments to represent the realistic effects of physical channel, topology, mobility, and jamming on spectrum agility, situational awareness, and network resiliency. We also provide the flexibility to scale up the test environment by introducing virtual radios and establishing seamless signal-level interactions with real radios. This holistic wireless evaluation approach supports a large-scale, het- erogeneous, and dynamic CR network architecture and allows developing cross-layer network protocols under high fidelity, repeatable, and scalable wireless test scenarios suitable for heterogeneous space, air, and ground networks. © 2012 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).},

This trend requires the agile construction of applications which the long development cycle such as waterfall software-development model could not satisfy. This paper proposes a cooperative construction approach based on multi-level abstraction for SaaS applications, in which the tenant instance of a SaaS application will be abstracted into different levels according to its customization requirements, and then be constructed from different components and through different constructing routes with the collaboration of different participants in a SaaS system. We discuss the multi-level components model, the roles and the cooperative work, the multi-level construction method in details. We also introduce a case study of a SaaS application for supply business in automobile industry with the discussion of agile construction approaches. © 2012 IEEE.},

The adoption of SaaS and cloud computing has shown a different approach to managing requirements, adding frequent and rigorous experimentation to the development process with the intent of minimizing R&D investment between customer proof points. This offers several benefits including increased customer satisfaction, improved and quantified business goals and the transformation to a continuous rather than waterfall development process.

abstract={High throughput and complexity reduction remain major requirements of future wireless communication system implementations. On the Other hand, iterative processing is being widely investigated and proposed nowadays to cope with the increasing transmission quality requirement. Howerver, these advanced techniques pose a real challenge in terms of achieving high throughput and reduced complexity implementations. A typical example in this domain is the significant performance improvement offered by the use of iterative demodulation with turbo decoding in severe channel conditions. For this iterative system, and targeting a highly parallel architecture for high throughput feature, we analyze the impact of computation scheduling on the complexity. We demonstrate that the adoption of advanced shuffled scheduling can lead to significant complexity reduction. Simulations show that applying the Butterfly-Replica schedule in the turbo decoder reduces the overall number of iterations by at least one iteration in the waterfall region with respect to the Butterfly schedule. This gain in number of iterations comes without any overhead in terms of area and without any lose is communication performance. Howerver, it results in a throughput improvement around 33% and a complexity reduction up to 22% in arithmetic operations, 14.6% in read access memory, and -39.3% in write access memory for the considered configurations. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Service infrastructures are often key for the efficient operation of complex environments, such as a large Smart Home infrastructure for a mining camp. The evolution of such service infrastructures, in response to an increased workload on the system or a changing resource allocation, is often tedious and expensive, due to weak evolvability support of its service portfolio. This underpins the need for services to be designed with high evolvability characteristics. Semantic Web technologies have been anticipated as a basis for the required Web service evolution. JSON-LD is a prominent Semantic Web technology used in combination with ontologies, developed with the Web Ontology Language (OWL), to face the evolutionary challenges. Our applied research investigates common Web service tasks, automated using above technologies. It is explained, that this enables the creation of evolutionary building blocks. These building blocks are incrementally combined here for the overall service portfolio, culminating in a model of a semantic agent which excels in its capacity to evolve. Our model is then adopted and assessed for the system infrastructure of the Smart Camp project, as a use case for an agile, complex logistic environment. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={We consider high-level models that specify system behaviors probabilistically and support the specification of cost attributes. Specifically, we focus on Discrete Time Markov Reward Models (D-MRMs), i.e. state machines where probabilities can be associated with transitions and rewards (costs) can be associated with states and transitions. Through probabilities we model assumptions on the behavior of environment in which an application is embedded. Rewards can instead model the cost assumptions involved in the system's operations. A system is designed to satisfy the requirements, under the given assumptions. Design-time assumptions, however, can turn out to be invalid at runtime, and therefore it is necessary to verify whether changes may lead to requirements violations. If they do, it is necessary to adapt the behavior in a self-healing manner to continue to satisfy the requirements. We have previously presented an approach to support efficient runtime probabilistic model checking of DTMCs for properties expressed in PCTL. In this paper we extend the approach to D-MRMs and reward properties. The benefits of the approach are justified both theoretically and empirically on significant test cases. © 2012 IEEE.},

However, like sentences whispered in a children's telephone game, as an issue moves through a software development process, it may undergo many changes, making it difficult to ensure that the problem reported was actually fixed. To better understand how software teams preserve the integrity of user-reported issues, we observed a software team over a 6-month period, analyzing the trajectory of user requests through their software development processes. Our observations revealed several representations of issues, highlighting several points where information about an issue was lost or transformed. Although this information loss appeared to be unavoidable as an issue went through the resolution process, we found it was offset by a web of transactive memory distributed throughout the support and product teams. This memory was reinforced by asynchronous chat about recent and commonly reported issues, and shared notions of what issues should be considered severe or urgent. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Software engineering is increasingly carried out in distributed settings. Software engineers are becoming more nomadic in carrying out their work, working from the customer location, the headquarters of their own company, their home, or sometimes even from their holiday locations. Technological support is needed to overcome the negative impacts of distance that are introduced by this trend. The central theme in this paper for supporting dislocated software engineers lies in increasing their awareness level to a level similar to (or even exceeding) what they experience in a co-located setting. In this paper we present the context in which we are bootstrapping a custom fit environment to support a team of fully dislocated software engineers and the incremental process we use. By working in this fashion we are discovering the requirements to support fully distributed teams while at the same time providing our setting with working solutions to help them with their day to day challenges. Finally, this continuous practical use also provides us with empirical data to validate the increase in awareness levels of dislocated software engineers and helps us in pinpointing important open research challenges. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Both agile software development and lean architecture have been studied in the software engineering field. Combining these two approaches has also been investigated. However, the existing research and practices only present the principles but fail to develop a framework of the software development for practitioners to follow. In this paper, a framework about how naïve agile practices could be fulfilled by introducing "lean" practices under the DCI (Data-Context-Interaction) paradigm is proposed. Lean practice is an end-user-focused and value-centric system design. In the proposed framework, lean architecture is complementary to agile principles and disciplines and supports agile development. This paper is exploring the possibilities of how agile methods can restore its lost insights and possibly be reinforced by lean thinking. Meanwhile, it is also examined what lean can do "beyond" agile. A new lean approach to building domain architecture comes from Data-Context-Interaction (DCI) paradigm which facilitates to represent the domain architecture intuitively. DCI approach allows us to successfully decouple between domain and business-logic features and provides an approach for lean practitioners to design system architecture much closer to the real-world domain. It is claimed that the investment into lean and agile methodologies go hand in hand from organizational to technical aspects by tying up with lean concepts as the backbone for agile methods. How lean makes it right and how agile makes it fast with the DCI paradigm will be demonstrated with an example. The main contribution to the software development will be presented. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Cognitive Radio is an enabling agile technology for communication and channels sharing in multimedia and wireless networks. The authors consider multimedia traffic transmission over Cognitive Radio (CR) networks using a progressive source coding associated to fountain codes. For a Cognitive Radio infrastructure where the spectrum is owned by Primary Users (PUs) that have Binomial and/or Poissonian traffics, Secondary Users (SUs) are allowed to share these spectral resources using the Opportunistic Spectrum Sharing feature of the Cognitive Radio concept. The objective of this paper lies in characterizing the reliability and as a result evaluating the performance of the secondary multimedia service provision under both primary traffic types in lossy Cognitive Radio environments. The authors have conducted a general analysis for many still open issues in Cognitive Radio and tackle three critical factors responsible for secondary service disruption: primary traffic interruptions, concurrent access to shared frequency bands leading to collisions and subchannels characteristics. Numerical simulations, in view of the average Spectral Efficiency, examine the performance of the multimedia transmission under the primary interruptions caused by the Binomial and the Poissonian primary applications and consider also the dynamics between the competing secondary peers in addition to subchannels fading and noise.

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the antecedents and implications of aligning the organizational values embedded in a systems development approach (e.g. agile) with the organizational values of project team members. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative case study approach is used to examine systems development project teams at three organizations, each using a development approach that incorporates different organizational value dimensions. Interviews were conducted with developers, systems analysts, and managers regarding their systems development experiences. A structured coding of the interview transcripts was then completed to enable analysis of value dimensions. Findings: By comparing the dominant values between the project teams and their development approach, varying degrees of alignment were identified. Where alignment is high, perceptions of the systems development process are associated with satisfaction and enthusiasm; where alignment is low, perceptions focus on frustration and discontent. Research limitations/implications: Based on the study's findings, four propositions pertaining to the antecedents and implications of IS values alignment are outlined for examination in future research. Practical implications: The findings from this study can aid managers who are considering the use of a new systems development approach or evaluating the effectiveness of their current approach. By determining the degree of information systems (IS) values alignment, organizations may be able to customize their development approach to be more consistent with the team's values, in order to minimize negative development process perceptions and increase project performance. Originality/value: This research extends past studies of organizational values and alignment by introducing the concept of IS values alignment. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Customised agile product shape development requires intelligent integration of multiple designers' inputs to fit various customer preferences. This study proposes a robust feature-based product modelling architecture for design customisation, which represents the product modelling processes as constrained morphing of relatively constant base feature with customised defined working features by subjecting to corresponding boundary constraints. The deformation on the surface patches of working features is adaptively controlled by the proposed energy-based solid mechanics surface model. The techniques on the construction of surface control network of springs, model segmentation, displacement computation of network nodes, as well as surface morphing processes are introduced in detail. The shape deformation process is uniformed across the surface control network, maintaining the shape being similar to its imported source pattern. This paper discusses examples and case study in footwear industry. The proposed method could be applied for customised product development in other related industries.

abstract={Purpose: Many organizations are outsourcing their information technology (IT) related services to a third party vendor for quite some time. However, the IT services industry including outsourcing is going through rapid changes with the increasing adoption of Cloud computing. The purpose of this paper is to compare global IT outsourcing with Cloud computing along with the evolution of traditional IT services. Design/methodology/approach: Cloud computing is a model for provisioning and consuming IT capabilities on a need and pay by use basis. This helps in shifting the cost structure from capital expenditure to operating expenditure and also helps the IT systems to be more agile. This innovative model of acquiring IT related services has made organizations revisit their infrastructure and platform services strategy and optimize their IT spending while improving overall agility. This paper compares global IT outsourcing with Cloud computing along with the evolution of traditional IT services. Findings: The impact of Cloud computing on IT outsourcing is no doubt significant. Cloud computing represents a fundamental shift in how organizations pay for and access IT services. It has created new opportunities for IT services providers and the outsourcing vendors will have to modify their strategy to take advantage of this new computing paradigm. Practical implications: This research is relevant for practitioners as well as researchers in the field of IT outsourcing and Cloud computing. Originality/value: This research compares global outsourcing with Cloud computing along with the evolution of IT services. Very little research has been done in this nascent and important area. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Agile methodologies such as XP and Scrum are founded upon the four values and twelve principles of agile software development. A software development project is only considered to be truly agile if these values and principles are followed. However, software developed for use in medical devices must be regulatory compliant and this can make the process of following a single agile methodology such as XP difficult to achieve. This paper outlines how we identified the barriers to agile adoption in the medical device software domain through performing a survey. These barriers include: lack of documentation; maintaining traceability; regulatory compliance; lack of up front planning and the process of managing multiple releases. Based on this research recommendations are also made as to how these barriers can be overcome. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={In Behavior Driven Development (BDD), acceptance tests provide the starting point for the software design flow and serve as a basis for the communication between designers and stakeholders. In this agile software development technique, acceptance tests are written in natural language in order to ensure a common understanding between all members of the project. As a consequence, mapping the sentences to actual source code is the first step of the design flow, which is usually done manually. However, the scenarios described by the acceptance tests provide enough information in order to automatize the extraction of both the structure of the implementation and the test cases. In this work, we propose an assisted flow for BDD where the user enters into a dialog with the computer which suggests code pieces extracted from the sentences. For this purpose, natural language processing techniques are exploited. This allows for a semi-automatic transformation from acceptance tests to source code stubs and thus provides a first step towards an automatization of BDD. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The most popular Software Process Models worldwide are ISO/IEC 15504 and CMMI. It is desirable for organizations to have assessments according to both these models but every assessment is expensive both financially and time-wise, and furthermore new assessments are required when a new models version is released. In order to define and/or to improve their software process, organizations choose different Software Development Methodologies. It is important for the organization to know what capability/maturity of the process a chosen methodology could ensure. In order to solve these problems we propose Transitional Software Process Model (TSPM). It enables the transformation of results of an assessment according to one Process Model to other models and determines what capability/maturity according to different Process Models a chosen methodology could ensure. Also, TSPM ensures transition of the existing assessment results to a new version of the model without reassessment. The principles of TSPM implementation are given in this article. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Software industry is increasingly using Agile Methods due to its benefits. However due to increase in companies getting global distributed teams working on a single project from various parts of the world is becoming a challenge to inline this with Agile Principles. In such cases software industry has adapted Agile methods according to their particular needs. This adaptive arrangement is found to be divergent to basic Agile Principles. Customer collocation is one of the basic motivations and focus of Agile but under certain conditions as proved by the case study explained in this paper it does not impact success of projects. This paper is a detailed study of a software development organization following SCRUM for developing software products of its own. However after initial development they develop tailored products on customers' indentation. The study shows factors and impacts of successful surge of product even with absence of real customer throughout the customized product development. It is concluded that prior experience with same domain alternate customer representations, effective communications within team mitigates the effects of no onsite customer. On basis of the findings a framework is introduced which combines the success oriented factors. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={This paper presents the process of measuring the level of quality control process to ensure the quality of delivered software package during the development cycle. The success of the project requires three prerequisites and they constrain one another. Quality is the most important factor for successful project completion. In other words, quality should not be sacrificed for the sake of meeting cost budget or delivering within schedule. Also, cost caused by any quality issues such as defect resolution increases exponentially once the product is out of the door. Having said that, we also have to consider the schedule side of constraints for the successful project. In other words, we have no time to do a quality job and we have to compete with other competitors to ship the product to the market earlier than them. So, the quality measurement and management concept is introduced to meet the agile software development environment in conjunction with performance strategies to execute within organization. Obviously, there are many key performance indexes derivable from the actual data associated with quality control activities and it is desirable to create a quality process to integrally represent overall level of quality control activities performed while developing the software deliverables. With the quality process, it is possible to evaluate whether enough quality control activities are performed for the project officially and secure the quality of the software deliverables before it is delivered to the customers. © 2011 Song and Kim; licensee InTech.},

Instead, they are common in all medium and large enterprises, e.g., when replacing applications with new (standard) software or when consolidating the IT landscape in the aftermath of mergers and acquisitions activities. General-purpose methodologies such as Scrum focus on managing projects. However, they do not discuss (data-migration) domain-specific tasks. These tasks are the focus and contribution of this paper. It elaborates and compiles them into a process-model. The model defines the logical and temporal dependencies between the tasks and clarifies roles and responsibilities in a migration project. Thereby, the variety of used know-how-sources sets this paper apart from any previous work in this area.

By integrating theories from systems development methodologies, diffusion of innovations, and agile methodology literature, this paper proposes a new model that identifies a set of critical factors pertinent to post-adoptive usage of agile practices. This model is used to inform analysis of post-adoptive usage of agile practices in two major organizations. The results indicate relative advantage, team attitude and technical competence, championing, and top management support (TMS) are the key factors determining the extent to which agile practices can be assimilated into an organization. Specifically, both findings and this model confirm that the deeper the assimilation of agile practices into the organization, the better understanding of how assimilation leads to specific improvements in its systems development outcomes. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We also computed metrics derived from the class dependency graph, including metrics derived from Social Network Analysis. The application development evolved through phases, characterized by a different level of adoption of some key agile practices - namely pair programming, test-based development and refactoring. The evolution of the metrics of the system, and their behavior related to the agile practices adoption level, is presented and discussed. We show that, in the reported case study, a few metrics are enough to characterize with high significance the various phases of the project. Consequently, software quality, as measured using these metrics, seems directly related to agile practices adoption. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Enterprise architecture (EA) is a new approach that organizations should practice to align their business strategic objectives with information and communication technology (ICT). Enterprise Architecture encompasses a collection of different views and aspects of the enterprise which constitute a comprehensive overview. Such an overview cannot be well-organized regardless of incorporating a logical structure called Enterprise Architecture Framework (EAF). EAF presents a comprehensive and transparent map of an organization showing how all organization elements (business and IT) work together to achieve defined business objectives. It clarifies the way in which these elements support the business processes of the organization. Several distinctive EAF have been proposed till now, the main challenges any of these EAF faced are (1) defining process is heavy, prolonged and tedious (2) Keeping EA artifacts up-to-date is an awkward work. These challenges make the artifacts of EA useless and unreliable. A number of researchers and practitioners try to eliminate these challenges by using Service Oriented (SO) paradigm with common and famous EAF like Zachman and FEAF. But none of them completely clarify how SO practices with EA concepts combination may be realized and what are the important elements of it, they just show an abstract mapping between these two concepts and state that this combination can be possible. In this article we try to present a service oriented EAF (SOEAF) to eliminate aforementioned challenges and elaborated this framework in details. CEA Framework involves a SO Roadmap that is completely compatible with ITIL and a Classification Schema that cover all aspects of organization, these aspects categorize according to Purpose, Pattern or Practice, Policy, Stakeholder and Resource. We believe that by using the proposed SOEAF referred to as CEA Framework, created enterprise architecture is flexible and agile enough to define rapidly and sense the environment quickly then, adapt and adopt business and information changes appropriately. © 2005 - 2012 JATIT & LLS.

abstract={Although many organizations operate in a process-driven way, few members are skilled in specifying and developing business processes-a skill that has become crucial for organization development, in particular to establish agile enterprises. This paper shows, on the basis of natural language constructs (subject, predicate, object) and communication patterns between actors (subjects), how individual members of an organization could contribute to coherent and intelligible process specifications. A language and tool supporting Subject-oriented Business Process Management (S-BPM) are introduced, allowing organizations to cope with strategic and operational challenges dynamically. As many organizations already work with BPM concepts and technologies, existing approaches to process modelling are also revisited with respect to representing natural language constructs and standard sentence syntax. Since most of them refer either to subjects, predicates, objects or to a respective combination, a roadmap can be developed for enriching existing modelling approaches. In doing so, organizations can benefit from stakeholder inputs for effective business process engineering re-using existing specifications. © 2011 The Author(s).},

abstract={Agile methodologies are often not used "out of the box" by practitioners, instead they select the practices that fit their needs best. However, little is known which agile practices the practitioners choose. This study investigates agile practice adoption by asking practitioners which practices they are using on project and organizational level. We investigated how commonly used individual agile practices are, combinations of practices and their frequency of usage, as well as the degree of compliance to agile methodologies (Scrum and XP), and as how successful practitioners perceive the adoption. The research method used is survey. The survey has been sent to over 600 respondents, and has been posted on LinkedIn, Yahoo, and Google groups. In total 109 answers have been received. Practitioners can use the knowledge of the commonality of individual practices and combinations of practices as support in focusing future research efforts, and as decision support in selecting agile practices. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

From an industrial perspective, the paper provides a prescription on how to implement agile software development outside the typical domains for agile, in this case for mass-produced products with embedded software governed by a stage-gate process for mechanics and hardware. From a research perspective, the paper provides an analysis of the software development cycle for products with embedded software, especially where product development as a whole is driven by a plan-driven process.

abstract={One of the hallmarks of a co-located agile team is the simple and open flow of information between its members. In a co-located setting, peripheral awareness, osmotic communication and simple information radiators support agile principles such as collective ownership, minimal documentation and simple design, and facilitate smooth collaboration. However in a dispersed agile team, where individual team members are distributed across several sites, these mechanisms are not available and information sharing has to be more explicit. Research into distributed software development has been tackling similar issues, but little work has been reported into dispersed agile teams. This paper reports on a field study of one successful partially dispersed agile team. Using a distributed cognition analysis which focuses on information propagation and transformation within the team we investigate how the team collaborates and compare our findings with those from co-located teams. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

In this paper we argue that shared organizational values, which we call organizational Superego, should be the main drivers for the deployment and post-deployment assessment of agile methods and techniques. Along with that we propose a new organizational classification technique, which assesses the power of the Superego to shape organizational behavior, together with an organizational value framework to be used for strengthening it. We further discuss how a strong Superego would approach the deployment of agile methods and techniques, and outline a future agile deployment framework, based on organizational values. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

There exists an interesting debate in the agile and usability communities about how to achieve this integration. Our aim is to contribute to this debate by discussing the incorporation of particular usability recommendations into user stories, one of the most popular artifacts for communicating agile requirements. In this paper, we explore the implications of usability for both the structure of and the process for defining user stories. We discuss what changes the incorporation of particular usability issues may introduce in a user story. Although our findings require more empirical validation, we think that they are a good starting point for further research on this line. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Agile development approaches are increasingly being followed and favored by the industry. Test Driven Development (TDD) is a key agile practice and recent research results suggest that the successful adoption of TDD depends on different limiting factors, one of them being insufficient developer testing skills. The goal of this paper is to investigate if developers who are educated on general testing knowledge will be able to utilize TDD more effectively. We conducted a controlled experiment with master students during the course on Software Verification & Validation (V&V) where source code and test cases created by each participant during the labs as well as their answers on a survey questionnaire were collected and analyzed. Descriptive statistics indicate improvements in statement coverage. However, no statistically significant differences could be established between the pre- and post-course groups of students. By qualitative analysis of students' tests, we noticed a lack of test cases for non-stated requirements ("negative"tests) resulting in a non-detection of bugs. Students did show preference towards TDD in surveys. Although further research is required to fully establish this, we believe that identifying specific testing knowledge which is complementary to the testing skills of a new TDD developer would enable developers to perform their tasks in a more efficient manner. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has recently begun an effort to further refine its Fractionated Spacecraft vision. This vision (called the "F6" program) seeks to explore distributed spacecraft architectures capable of performing complex functions similar to current monolithic spacecrafts. However, the ability of fractionated systems to work separately would provide significant benefits not achievable by monolithic systems. The question of interest to this study was "Can these benefits be quantified and evaluated in a meaningful fashion in order to compare them to monolithic architectures?" Rather than narrowing the approach to one or two concepts, the strategy was to expand the decision space in order to generate and evaluate a variety of alternatives under different scenarios and design choices. The stimuli were specifically selected to capture many issues not included in such studies such as technology obsolescence, funding profile changes, equipment failure scenarios, and even changes to mission objectives during the mission. Each stimulus has a variety of decision options or responses which a manager can exercise including delay, cancellation, acceleration of a development, or even new developments. It is argued that the very nature of fractionation will result in systems far more agile to external (and internal) stimuli, but this has never been shown explicitly. This study explores the use of Real Options in conjunction with traditional Net Present Value techniques to quantify the desirability of alternative candidate designs in terms of their adaptability and survivability. Our approach to evaluating the business case for each use case was to explicitly model both the implementation and operation phases for the life cycle of a fractionated cluster. The models were integrated into Phoenix Integration's ModelCenter® framework and used to generate Implementation Value Metrics (IVMs) and Operational Value Metrics (OVMs) associated with the use cases under evaluation. A number of models were developed to support these evaluations using Excel, Matlab, and Arena® (a commercial discrete-event simulation software product). The Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach used in this study yielded transformations between high-level frameworks (OWL and SysML) and the models used to generate the data we needed for the evaluation. This rule-based transformation process will be critical for exploring the large decision trade spaces in a reasonable amount of time. This paper presents the results of the business case analyses; the underlying OVM's and IVM's, the approaches used to model the problem, explore the tradespace, refine the exploration, and generate results. We also discuss possible directions for future work. Specifically, it should be noted that while the approach described herein is being developed for, and funded by, DARPA, it has general applicability to a much wider variety of applications. © 2012 IEEE.},

We introduce FAME - a Framework for Agile Media Experiences - which addresses this scalability problem. FAME allows media creators to define abstract page models that are subsequently transformed into real experiences through algorithmic experimentation. FAME's page models are hierarchically composed of simple building blocks, mirroring the structure of most Web pages. They are resolved into concrete page instances by pluggable algorithms which optimize the pages for specific business goals. Our framework allows retrieving dynamic content from multiple sources, defining the experimentation's degrees of freedom, and constraining the algorithmic choices. It offers an effective separation of concerns in the media creation process, enabling multiple stakeholders with profoundly different skills to apply their crafts and perform their duties independently, composing and reusing each other's work in modular ways.

The contribution of this paper is to illustrate the reasons for tailoring Agile practices within the context of large enterprises. The findings show that scrum roles and practices did not conflict with enterprise policies or processes and were thought to improve product quality and productivity. However, agile practices from the XP tradition were not so widely adopted. Test driven development did not integrate well within enterprises where independent quality assurance teams were constituted as separate departments. Continuous integration was found to be challenging where enterprise software products required time consuming regression testing and elaborate code release processes. While adoption of coding standards and collective code ownership are necessary to facilitate interaction between disparate stakeholder groups. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Agile methods are an established process for developing software nowadays. There is, however, less evidence on their usage among software practitioners in Malaysia. While the methods have become mainstream in other regions, that is not the case in this country. This paper empirically investigates the perceptions of Agile methods usage from seven organisations involving 14 software practitioners in Malaysia. Our participants are using Scrum and have a maximum of five years experience. We categorised our findings in terms of awareness, introduction, and challenges they are facing, together with the suggested and practiced solution from them. Interestingly, a change in mind set when practicing Agile was identified to be helpful in reducing the challenges. Lastly we present the practices in Agile they perceived to deliver the most benefits. We found that the use of Agile is still emerging in the country, and awareness is still lacking especially within the government sector. Although several challenges have been encountered when introducing Agile in their organisations, the benefits of Agile are reported to be in Agile practices such as: the involvement from all parties from the beginning, daily stand-up meeting, iterative and incremental, applying burn down chart, sprint and continuous integration. We aim to provide awareness and knowledge about Agile methods to the practitioners in the country and the nearby region. This paper can serve as a reference to the early adopters who intend to use Agile methods in the future. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper focuses on identifying the important aspects of Agile adoption from software practitioners in Malaysia. We analyse 27 Agile adoption variables from a survey of early Agile users in Malaysia. Factor analysis is conducted to identify the clusters of the variables (or items) and how they are inter-related to produce factors. Most of the respondents are from software organisations in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, in which most of the companies are located in Malaysia. The clusters of variables resulting from this analysis can serve as a reference to the practitioners planning to adopt the methodology. The top factors identified from this study are shown in terms of (i) developer involvement and organisation-related aspects, (ii) cultural and people related aspects and (iii) customer collaboration and the need for professional skills when using Agile methods. In addition, factor analysis discovered that practitioners disagreed about the importance of the technical aspects of Agile. While we believe that these findings are particularly important from the Malaysian perspective, however, they also help add to the body of evidence in the field of software engineering and software process particularly in terms of Agile methods adoption. Moreover, the study also can help adopters from the nearby geographical regions to understand and see the suitability of Agile methods for their organisations. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={To combat the increasing trends of security breaches reported nowadays, there is a need to deploy strict security activities with various development methodologies. In the present work we are focusing on an extremely popular agile development Methodology. These methodologies are informal and lightweight in nature having short timescales. But integration of security activities with agile activities always falls short of expectations, as security practices are not able to adapt such characteristics possessed by agile software easily. Therefore a proper integration methodology is required to achieve this aim. Here we propose a novel approach which provides quantitative measure of agility for security activities in terms of real agility degree (RAD). It determines the degree of compatibility of a security activity with agile process. We have also presented a comparative analysis of security activities with each other in context of RAD and risk removal efficiency factor (RREF). RREF is an assessment of how much effective a security activity is for removing the risk. This comparison will assist a developer during software development in deciding which security activity is beneficial than the other for integration. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={A key part of software architecture is the design of the high level structure of a software system - an exercise in planning ahead. Agile software development methods discourage planning ahead, encapsulated by the Agile Manifesto philosophy "[we value] responding to change over following aplan". Development without architecture planning risks failure. This leads to an apparent paradox: how can you design an architecture while using a methodology that promotes not planning ahead? This paper introduces Grounded Theory research that is exploring the factors that affect how much architecture planning industry practitioners do up-front - in other words, how much architecture? Early results show that the experience of the architects and predefined or template architectures both help to reduce the architectural effort required without sacrificing the benefits of a full architecture design. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The final stage in the IBM DeepQA pipeline involves ranking all candidate answers according to their evidence scores and judging the likelihood that each candidate answer is correct. In DeepQA, this is done using a machine learning framework that is phase-based, providing capabilities for manipulating the data and applying machine learning in successive applications. We show how this design can be used to implement solutions to particular challenges that arise in applying machine learning for evidence-based hypothesis evaluation. Our approach facilitates an agile development environment for DeepQA; evidence scoring strategies can be easily introduced, revised, and reconfigured without the need for error-prone manual effort to determine how to combine the various evidence scores. We describe the framework, explain the challenges, and evaluate the gain over a baseline machine learning approach. © 1957-2012 IBM.},

abstract={Background: Antimicrobial resistance has reached globally alarming levels and is becoming a major public health threat. Lack of efficacious antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems was identified as one of the causes of increasing resistance, due to the lag time between new resistances and alerts to care providers. Several initiatives to track drug resistance evolution have been developed. However, no effective real-time and source-independent antimicrobial resistance monitoring system is available publicly. Objective: To design and implement an architecture that can provide real-time and source-independent antimicrobial resistance monitoring to support transnational resistance surveillance. In particular, we investigated the use of a Semantic Web-based model to foster integration and interoperability of interinstitutional and cross-border microbiology laboratory databases. Methods: Following the agile software development methodology, we derived the main requirements needed for effective antimicrobial resistance monitoring, from which we proposed a decentralized monitoring architecture based on the Semantic Web stack. The architecture uses an ontology-driven approach to promote the integration of a network of sentinel hospitals or laboratories. Local databases are wrapped into semantic data repositories that automatically expose local computing-formalized laboratory information in the Web. A central source mediator, based on local reasoning, coordinates the access to the semantic end points. On the user side, a user-friendly Web interface provides access and graphical visualization to the integrated views. Results: We designed and implemented the online Antimicrobial Resistance Trend Monitoring System (ARTEMIS) in a pilot network of seven European health care institutions sharing 70+ million triples of information about drug resistance and consumption. Evaluation of the computing performance of the mediator demonstrated that, on average, query response time was a few seconds (mean 4.3, SD 0.1×10 2 seconds). Clinical pertinence assessment showed that resistance trends automatically calculated by ARTEMIS had a strong positive correlation with the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) (ρ =.86, P &lt;.001) and the Sentinel Surveillance of Antibiotic Resistance in Switzerland (SEARCH) (ρ =.84, P &lt;.001) systems. Furthermore, mean resistance rates extracted by ARTEMIS were not significantly different from those of either EARS-Net (Δ = ±0.130; 95% confidence interval -0 to 0.030; P &lt;.001) or SEARCH (δ = ±0.042; 95% confidence interval -0.004 to 0.028; P =.004). Conclusions: We introduce a distributed monitoring architecture that can be used to build transnational antimicrobial resistance surveillance networks. Results indicated that the Semantic Web-based approach provided an efficient and reliable solution for development of eHealth architectures that enable online antimicrobial resistance monitoring from heterogeneous data sources. In future, we expect that more health care institutions can join the ARTEMIS network so that it can provide a large European and wider biosurveillance network that can be used to detect emerging bacterial resistance in a multinational context and support public health actions. © Douglas Teodoro, Emilie Pasche, Julien Gobeill, Stéphane Emonet, Patrick Ruch, Christian Lovis.},

abstract={As a scientific and professional discipline, the design of enterprise systems has undergone an impressive development. Today, it has achieved a well-established practice with clearly defined phases, tasks and methods. However, enterprises are challenged by increased complexity in their operations, externally imposed uncertainties and even unforeseeable events. Dynamic global operations call for speedy and effective responses to change. As a consequence, enterprises are challenged to adopt new approaches. In view of this call for probing new roads, it seems useful to examine the roots of design in an effort to re-interpret many of the original ideas. In this paper, we shall briefly study significant contributions to decision-making, systems theory, project management, behavioral science and organization theory, as well as business aspects. To further understand the nature of design, we shall discuss key features, such as purposeful intent based on a stakeholder approach, situational approach, integration of subsystems, perspectives and time horizons, the design process, and modeling. Recent developments, e.g. in design science, design thinking, managing as designing, participatory design, and agile project management, have provided a number of new approaches that in many ways represent answers to the challenges of increased uncertainty and complexity. This has led to the development of seven propositions: • Understanding mutual interplay of actors - unveiling self-sustaining informal learning processes • Involving stakeholders - clarifying who wants to see the design succeed • Accepting diversity - working with several perspectives in parallel • Experimenting with new ideas - establishing a playful and creative mood among participants • Enacting key features of new systems design - involving users in testing a series of prototypes • Including the organizational context - orchestrating a design effort in view of simultaneous development initiatives and top management's shifting agenda • Acknowledging that the intentions of an enterprise information system are realized through people - An enterprise information system only sets the stage for organizational processes. If adopted in an enterprise, management will be challenged to carry out design activities in a radically different way. © 2012 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

Two surveys in 2010 were conducted at North Carolina State University to weigh the community's view of the principles and use of associated practices. Respondents' commentary emphasized delivery of a solution with high business value to a customer early and often, along with willingness to respond to feedback. Principle 7 attracted the most comments, with respondents saying that it, in particular, along with the full set of principles, in general, did not adequately emphasize the need to produce high-quality software and test and elicit non-functional requirements.

Qualitative data were collected from observations, interviews, and documents and analysed using TFs. The authors' findings show that viewing agile adoption as socio-technical innovation and change provides results that resonate with existing research in the area and extends it. The key contribution of this case study to the socio-technical literature on systems development is a practical demonstration of how TFs can be used to facilitate the socio-technical understanding and identification of conflicts between stakeholder groups while going through the adoption of a new software development method.

abstract={Purpose: The aim of the paper is to contribute to the discussion of treating the concepts of lean and agile in isolation or combination by presenting an alternative view from complexity thinking on these concepts, considering an epistemological approach to this topic. Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts an epistemological approach, using the complexity thinking as the dominant paradigm from which to investigate the concepts and principles of lean and agile. Findings: The epistemological approach to the topic clearly reveals the opposition between two thinking principles: the principle of simplicity and the principle of complexity. Next, the authors evaluated how the complexity thinking principles of Morin may permit the two different ways of thinking to be reconciled. They find out that, in an organization, lean and agile are not only inseparable but also interdependent. Practical implications: The paper shows how the concepts of lean and agile can be combined, which may be of help to managers and project leaders to adopt from both practices and tools to improve their competitiveness. Originality/value: The novelty of this paper is the presentation of an alternative approach to the concepts of lean and agile, using an epistemological point-of-view. The paper deepens the understanding of the lean and agile concepts by applying the complexity paradigm as proposed by Edgar Morin.

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to explain how cloud computing - conducting business functions on shared, off-premises computing systems - introduces strategic options and business-control challenges for executives. For example, cloud computing offers ubiquitous access to applications for interacting with all parts of a firm's value chain and it connects an organization with the rich learning opportunities percolating in communities formed by the users of the service. Design/methodology/approach: The paper introduces a capabilities-comparison-matrix approach that executives can use to uncover, evaluate and rank opportunities for employing cloud computing to advance a challenger enterprise's growth strategy. Findings: For a firm hoping to grow, but with fewer resources than its rivals, cloud computing offers the potential to do more with less, thus benefiting an agile, strategic adopter of its rapidly evolving technology and service. Practical implications: Using cloud-based services, a challenger enterprise can identify, qualify, engage and manage a global network of capabilities to match the captive, in-house activities of a bigger, better-established competitor. Originality/value: The practical question for adopting any new technology is, "What is the value of what can we do (with the technology) that we could not do before?" To clarify choices, a capabilities-comparison matrix helps decision makers focus on which business activities should go into the "do" and "don't" classifications. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Mostly, previous ontology research focused on the reasoning results for the selected domain using ontology editor tools. This paper proposes an ontology model utilizing fuzzy variable and preference among parameters. For the evaluation of supply partners, utility function is adopted in the SWRL-based reasoning. The model is implemented using auto part to demonstrate the usefulness of the Semantic Web technology in the supply chain partnership. ICIC International © 2012.},

abstract={Scrum is one of the many agile approaches to software development that have been widely adopted over the past decade. Agile processes allow developers to embrace under-defined problems in complex environments where change in requirements is inevitable. The key agile features of Scrum are a flexible, adaptive schedule; democratic, collaborative teams; and frequent, iterative project and process reviews [2]. While students may engage with Scrum in the context of software development, the characteristics that suit many software problems to an agile approach also describe the student learning environment: complexity (new and unfamiliar concepts), under-defined problem space (students don't know what they don't know), short timeframe with frequent meetings (terms and class meetings), and inevitable change (apply new knowledge). This makes Scrum not only a software development strategy but a general learning strategy. Scrum facilitates frequent and iterative practice with timely feedback, development of mastery, and self-direction [1]. In this panel, the participants will describe how their students learn and practice Scrum in a software development context, how they use it to manage student projects outside the software development context, and how Scrum provides opportunities to integrate communication skills into the Computer Science (CS) and Software Engineering (SE) curricula. As participants in the NSF-funded CPATH II project (NSF Grants 0939122 and 0939081) "Incorporating Communication Skills Throughout Computer Science and Software Engineering Curricula," each panelist has developed Scrum-based assignments that exercise the skills of reading, writing, speaking, and teaming. The participants will discuss the design of these assignments and their experiences with them to date. © 2012 Authors.},

abstract={The use of agile principles and practices in software development is becoming a powerful force in today's workplace. In our quest to develop better products, therefore, it is imperative that we strive to learn and understand the application of agile methods, principles and techniques to the software development enterprise. Unfortunately, in many educational institutions, courses and projects that emphasize agile software development are minimal. At best, students have only limited exposure to the agile philosophy, principles and practices at the graduate and undergraduate levels of education. In an effort to address this concern, we offered an advanced graduate-level course entitled "Agile Software Engineering" in the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech. The primary objectives of the course were to introduce the values, principles and practices underlying the agile philosophy, and to do so in an atmosphere that encour-ages debate and critical thinking. The course was designed around three central components: (1) teaching the essentials of how one develops a product within an agile framework, (2) having invited talks by notable industry experts, and (3) having students present and discuss current agile research topics and issues. This paper describes our experiences during the offering of that course, and in particular, the unique perspectives of the class instructor, the teaching assistant and a student who was enrolled in the course. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Agile software development methods and techniques have been demonstrated to improve employee morale, enhance end-product quality, and achieve customer satisfaction. Agile adoption always comes with special challenges and thus fundamental organizational changes are necessary for successful outcome. In this paper we present an in-depth case study for adopting Scrum in a multi-team and multi-project situation to a government entity in the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E). While there are many successful stories for adopting Scrum in large and small organizations, there is little known about adoption stories in a multi-project/multi-team environments. In this paper we present a case study for an unsuccessful adoption of Scrum in a government entity in the U.A.E. The government entity under study have used the traditional waterfall approach for many years and decided to move to Agile software development method. This study highlights the challenges faced during the adoption of Scrum method with recommendations to address them. Each organization has its unique properties and one case study is not enough to draw conclusions for the U.A.E environment. However, the results obtained from this paper help software engineers to better understand the development environment and context factors for software projects in the U.A.E and many lessons may be learned for future Agile adoption. © 2012 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.},

abstract={Context: Agile software development with its emphasis on producing working code through frequent releases, extensive client interactions and iterative development has emerged as an alternative to traditional plan-based software development methods. While a number of case studies have provided insights into the use and consequences of agile, few empirical studies have examined the factors that drive the adoption and use of agile. Objective: We draw on intention-based theories and a dialectic perspective to identify factors driving the use of agile practices among adopters of this software development methodology. Method: Data for the study was gathered through an anonymous online survey of software development professionals. We requested participation from members of a selected list of online discussion groups, and received 98 responses. Results: Our analyses reveal that subjective norm and training play a significant role in influencing software developers' use of agile processes and methods, while perceived benefits and perceived limitations are not primary drivers of agile use among adopters. Interestingly, perceived benefit emerges as a significant predictor of agile use only if adopters face hindrances to their agile practices. Conclusion: We conclude that research in the adoption of software development innovations should examine the effects of both enabling and detracting factors and the interactions between them. Since training, subjective norm, and the interplay between perceived benefits and perceived hindrances appear to be key factors influencing the adoption of agile methods, researchers can focus on how to (a) perform training on agile methods more effectively, (b) facilitate the dialog between developers and managers about perceived benefits and hindrances, and (c) capitalize on subjective norm to publicize the benefits of agile methods within an organization. Further, when managing the transition to new software development methods, we recommend that practitioners adapt their strategies and tactics contingent on the extent of perceived hindrances to the change. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={This paper critically discusses the use of Extensible Markup Language (XML) for agile supply chains and proposes practical guidelines and future research directions for the field. XML has been identified by many as a prominent technology for enabling electronic supply chain integration, but the adoption of it in the industry has been rather slow and limited. This paper discusses the factors that enable agility in supply chains, and explains why XML is the best candidate for facilitating such factors. Then the major XML-based integration initiatives such as ebXML, RosettaNet, and Web Services are diagnosed in terms of their pros and cons for supply chain agility, as well as the reasons for their slow diffusion. Based on the discussion, this paper proposes that: the integration efforts need to first focus on the industries that need agility; stringent business process standards are necessary; and implementation should be made much easier and more affordable for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Further research issues are also suggested based on the discussion. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

It is a detailed investigation of the performance of a nine-person software development team employed by BBCWorldwide based in London. The data collected in 2009 involved direct observations of the development team, the kanban boards, the daily stand-up meetings, semistructured interviews with a wide variety of staff, and statistical analysis. The evidence shows that over the 12-month period, lead time to deliver software improved by 37%, consistency of delivery rose by 47%, and defects reported by customers fell 24%. The significance of this work is showing that the use of lean methods including visual management, team-based problem solving, smaller batch sizes, and statistical process control can improve software development. It also summarizes key differences between agile and lean approaches to software development. The conclusion is that the performance of the software development team was improved by adopting a lean approach. The faster delivery with a focus on creating the highest value to the customer also reduced both technical and market risks. The drawbacks are that it may not fit well with existing corporate standards. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={M2M (Machine-to-Machine) Technology makes it possible to network all kinds of terminal devices and their corresponding enterprise applications. Therefore, several M2M platforms were developed in China in order to collect information from terminal devices dispersed all over the local places through 3G wireless network. However, when enterprise applications try to integrate with M2M platforms, they should be maintained and refactored to adapt the heterogeneous features and properties of M2M platforms. Moreover, syntactical and semantic unification for information sharing among applications and devices are still unsolved because of raw data transmission and the usage of distinguished business vocabularies. In this paper, we propose and develop an M2M Middleware to support agile application integration with M2M platform. This middleware imports the event engine and XML-based syntax to handle the syntactical unification, makes use of Ontology-based semantic mapping to solve the semantic unification and adopts WebService and ETL techniques to sustain multi-pattern interactive approach, in order to agilely make applications integrated with the M2M platform. Now, the M2M Middleware has been applied in the China Telecom M2M platform. The operation results show that applications will cost less time and workload when being integrated with M2M platform. © 2012 KSII.},

abstract={In the last decades the complexity of software development projects had a significant increase. This complexity emerges from the higher degree of sophistication in the contexts they aim to serve and from the evolution of the functionalities implemented by the applications However, many software corporations have a reduced dimension (micro, small or medium) which imposes a considerable constraint to the number of individuals that might be involved in each project. This limitation has obvious consequences to the individual's efficiency and effectiveness. In this paper we describe a Rational Unified Process (RUP) tailoring to simplify the number of RUP roles. With this tailoring we obtain one set of RUP roles that, without neglecting any critical role of the software development process, may easily be adopted by a small or medium software development team. In this paper, we present and justify a complete set of mapping rules between RUP roles and one possible configuration for small software development teams. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Many firms rely on a single new-product development process for all projects. But designing new products for different business contexts requires that a firm deploy different new-product development processes. Products designed for stable and mature end-user markets require a process optimized for control and efficiency. In contrast, first-of-a-kind "breakthrough" products require a more emergent process that aims to discover whether there is any market to be served in the first place. Applying a uniform "best-practice" process to all development efforts ignores the major differences between these projects and may result in missed opportunities. This article describes a framework to address this problem, allowing a firm to better align the design of its development processes to the specific aims of individual projects. We illustrate this framework with examples from Hewlett-Packard, a large, diversified electronics firm that has successfully piloted this new approach across multiple business units.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to discuss the latest information on cloud computing in a library context. Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts an investigative approach including literature review and vendor-provided information. Findings: Cloud computing is both a trend and technology to deliver software and hardware as a service, not as a product. It involves a centralized data center, virtual server space, and secure transfer of data over the internet. The alleged advantages of cloud computing include low cost to own (CTO), agile updates, openness, zero initial investment, just to name a few. Lately library system vendors have begun to deliver cloud computing options. For instance, Ex Libris will release Alma in early 2012. It is an Integrated Library System with a discovery layer based on cloud computing. Amazon (Elastic Compute Cloud called Amazon EC2) and other vendors also offer virtual servers for cloud computing and charge customers by hours, usage, and capacity. If this trend continues for the next several years, it is just a matter of time before librarians will face the decision as to whether they should move into compute cloud. Originality/value: The paper discusses this new trend, focusing on the pros and cons of moving into cloud computing for libraries. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={We consider planar upward drawings of directed graphs on arbitrary surfaces where the upward direction is defined by a vector field. This generalizes earlier approaches using surfaces with a fixed embedding in R 3 and introduces new classes of planar upward drawable graphs, where some of them even allow cycles. Our approach leads to a classification of planar upward embeddability. In particular, we show the coincidence of the classes of planar upward drawable graphs on the sphere and on the standing cylinder. These classes coincide with the classes of planar upward drawable graphs with a homogeneous field on a cylinder and with a radial field in the plane. A cyclic field in the plane introduces the new class RUP of upward drawable graphs, which can be embedded on a rolling cylinder. We establish strict inclusions for planar upward drawability on the plane, the sphere, the rolling cylinder, and the torus, even for acyclic graphs. Finally, upward drawability remains NP-hard for the standing cylinder and the torus; for the cylinder this was left as an open problem by Limaye et al. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={This paper discusses the proposed model of the collaborative virtual learning system for the introductory computer programming course which uses one of the collaborative learning techniques known as the "Think-Pair-Share". The main objective of this study is to design a model for an online learning system that facilitates the collaborative learning activities in a virtual environment such as online communications and pair or small group discussions. In order to model the virtual learning environment, the RUP methodology has been used where it involves the data collection phase and the analysis and design phase. Fifty respondents have been randomly selected to participate in the data collection phase to investigate the students' interest and learning styles as well as their learning preferences. The results have shown the needs for the development of online small group discussions that can be used as an alternative learning style for programming courses. The proposed design of the virtual learning system named as the Online Collaborative Learning System or OCLS is being depicted using the object-oriented models which are the use-case model and class diagram in order to show the concise processes of virtual "Think-Pair-Share" collaborative activities. The "Think-Pair-Share" collaborative learning technique that is being used in this model has been chosen because of its simplicity and relatively low-risk. This paper also presents the proposed model of the system's architecture that will become the guidelines for the physical development of OCLS using the web-based applications.},

abstract={Sound effects are often used to communicate important information in multimedia such as video games. For instance, they may tell the player that a character has just snuck up on them, is firing at them, or is about to paddle over a waterfall. Nevertheless, there are times when playing sound may be inappropriate, may be inaudible, may become fatiguing and/or may be inaccessible for hard of hearing and deaf users. Therefore, an alternative to sound that can relay the same information would be beneficial to many users. The majority of studies into alternative presentations of sound for these purposes have focused on dialogue at the expense of music and sound effects. The paper introduces a pilot study of " SoundSign" , a prototype symbolic representation of sound effects for multimedia, using an innovative icon and compass that indicates direction, sound cue and proximity. Users who have disabled the sound, are hearing-impaired or are otherwise unable to hear sound will still get the information needed. A description of SoundSign and the results of a usability test are presented. © 2011.},

At the time of the interviews the project had grown in size during the past 2,5 years from two collocated Scrum teams to 20 teams located in four countries and employing over 170 persons. In this paper we first describe our research approach and goals. Then we briefly summarize the preliminary results of this ongoing study: we explain how Scrum practices were scaled, as well as discuss the successes and challenges experienced when adopting the agile practices and scaling them, while at the same time growing the project size at a fast pace. Even though this project has been very successful from the business point of view, it has experienced a lot of problems in applying Scrum, especially related to scaling the agile practices. Thus, it seems that adapting Scrum practices to work well in a large distributed setting is challenging. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={The field of mobile applications and services continues to be one of the most rapidly evolving areas of communications. Modeling of domain-dependent aspects is a key prerequisite for the design of software for mobile systems. Most mobile systems include a more or less advanced model of selected aspects of the domain in which they are used. However, the traditional development approach to business applications, data base and general software is not suitable for mobile devices of the different paradigms. In this paper, we discuss the creation of such a model and its relevance for technical design of mobile software applications. The paper also reports from an empirical study where a methodology that combines both of these approaches was introduced and employed for modeling of the domain-dependent aspects that were relevant for the design of a mobile software component. The resulting models of domain-dependent aspects are presented, and the experiences from the modeling process are discussed. It strongly focus on the lightweight mobile service oriented common framework architectures for business applications running on mobile devices. It is concluded that a dual perspective based on both of the conventional approaches is relevant for capturing the aspects that are necessary for creating the domain-dependent models that are integrated in a mobile software system. As an architect, you are often challenged - by client enterprise architects and IT stakeholders - to articulate Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) patterns and service components in a nonproprietary, product-agnostic way. In this paper, use Unified Modeling Language (UML) models to describe the SOA architecture pattern and its associated service components. You also learn about the service components of the SOA pattern in the context of industry-standard UML formats to help stakeholders to better understand the components that constitute an SOA. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this study is to characterize, analyze, and demonstrate machine-understandable semantic process for validating, integrating, and processing technical design information. This establishes both a vision and tools for information reuse and semi-automatic processing in engineering design projects, including virtual machine laboratory applications with generated components. Design/methodology/approach: The process model has been developed iteratively in terms of action research, constrained by the existing technical design practices and assumptions (design documents, expert feedback), available technologies (pre-studies and experiments with scripting and pipeline tools), benchmarking with other process models and methods (notably the RUP and DITA), and formal requirements (computability and the critical information paths for the generated applications). In practice, the work includes both quantitative and qualitative components. Findings: Technical design processes may be greatly enhanced in terms of semantic process thinking, by enriching design information, and automating information validation and transformation tasks. Contemporary design information, however, is mainly intended for human consumption, and needs to be explicitly enriched with the currently missing data and interfaces. In practice, this may require acknowledging the role of technical information or knowledge engineer, to lead the development of the semantic design information process in a design organization. There is also a trade-off between machine-readability and system complexity that needs to be studied further, both empirically and in theory. Research limitations/implications: The conceptualization of the semantic process is essentially an abstraction based on the idea of progressive design. While this effectively allows implementing semantic processes with, e.g., pipeline technologies, the abstraction is valid only when technical design is organized into reasonably distinct tasks. Practical implications: Our work points out a best practice for technical information management in progressive design that can be applied on different levels. Social implications: Current design processes may be somewhat impaired by legacy practices that do not promote information reuse and collaboration beyond conventional task domains. Our work provides a reference model to analyze and develop design activities as formalized work-flows. This work should lead into improved industry design process models and novel CAD/CAM/PDM applications, thereby strengthening industry design processes. Originality/value: While extensively studied, semantic modeling in technical design has been largely dominated by the idea of capturing design artifacts without a clear rationale why this is done and what level of detail should be favored in models. In the semantic process presented in this article, the utility and the chief quality criteria of semantic models (of technical information and artifacts) are explicitly established by the semantic processing pipeline(s). This constructively explains the significance of semantic models as communication and information requirement interfaces, with concrete use cases.},

abstract={High energy consumption has become a critical problem for supercomputer systems. GPU clusters are becoming an increasingly popular architecture for building supercomputers because of its great improvement in performance. In this paper, we first formulate the tasks mapping problem as a minimal energy consumption problem with deadline constraint. Its optimizing object is very different from the traditional mapping problem which often aims at minimizing makespan or minimizing response time. Then a Waterfall Energy Consumption Model, which abstracts the energy consumption of one GPU cluster system into several levels from high to low, is proposed to achieve an energy efficient tasks mapping for large scale GPU clusters. Based on our Waterfall Model, a new task mapping algorithm is developed which tries to apply different energy saving strategies to keep the system remaining at lower energy levels. Our mapping algorithm adopts the Dynamic Voltage Scaling, Dynamic Resource Scaling and β-migration for GPU sub-task to significantly reduce the energy consumption and achieve a better load balance for GPU clusters. A task generator based on the real task traces is developed and the simulation results show that our mapping algorithm based on the Waterfall Model can reduce nearly 50% energy consumption compared with traditional approaches which can only run at a high energy level. Not only the task deadline can be satisfied, but also the task execution time of our mapping algorithm can be reduced. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={It is common in practice that a Software Product Line (SPL) is constructed by reengineering a set of existing variant products. To alleviate the problems of high risks of failures and the limitations of resources and cost, incremental reengineering towards a SPL is a natural choice in many cases. However, several problems remain unaddressed properly, such as how to define increments, how to satisfy regular product delivery in parallel with reengineering, and how to achieve early successes. In this paper, we report an industrial case study on a successful SPL-targeted reengineering project conducted in Alcatel-Lucent. In this project, the project team applied the principles of agile development in the process of SPL reengineering. The key practices of the project include value-based increment definition, domain-driven responsibility alignment, iterative component refactoring and integration. We analyze the reengineering process of a major component qualitatively and quantitatively, with the focus on initial investment required, trend of investment, returns on investment and quality improvement. Our case study shows that incremental and iterative approach with stakeholder-value considerations can help to achieve steady and successful SPL reengineering in a cost-effective manner. We also find that SPL adoption can be regarded as an emergent result of the reconstruction and improvement of existing product assets. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Objectives: Several alert systems have been developed to improve the patient safety aspects of clinical information systems (CIS). Most studies have focused on the evaluation of these systems, with little information provided about the methodology leading to system implementation. We propose here an 'agile' business rule design framework (BRDF) supporting both the design of alerts for the validation of drug prescriptions and the incorporation of the end user into the design process. Methods: We analyzed the unified process (UP) design life cycle and defined the activities, subactivities, actors and UML artifacts that could be used to enhance the agility of the proposed framework. We then applied the proposed framework to two different sets of data in the context of the Georges Pompidou University Hospital (HEGP) CIS. Results: We introduced two new subactivities into UP: business rule specification and business rule instantiation activity. The pharmacist made an effective contribution to five of the eight BRDF design activities. Validation of the two new subactivities was effected in the context of drug dosage adaption to the patients' clinical and biological contexts. Pilot experiment shows that business rules modeled with BRDF and implemented as an alert system triggered an alert for 5824 of the 71,413 prescriptions considered (8.16%). Conclusion: A business rule design framework approach meets one of the strategic objectives for decision support design by taking into account three important criteria posing a particular challenge to system designers: 1) business processes, 2) knowledge modeling of the context of application, and 3) the agility of the various design steps. © Schattauer 2011.},

On the other hand, cloud computing is already a reality that helps to save money by eliminating the hardware as well as software fixed costs and just pay per use. Indeed, specific software tools to exploit a cloud are also here. The trend in this case is toward using tools based on the MapReduce paradigm developed by Google. In this paper, we explore the possibility of having data in a cloud by using BigTable to store the corporate historical data and MapReduce as an agile mechanism to deploy cubes in ad-hoc Data Marts. Our main contribution is the comparison of three different approaches to retrieve data cubes from BigTable by means of MapReduce and the definition of criteria to choose among them. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={Healthcare information systems frequently do not truly meet clinician needs, due to the complexity, variability, and rapid change in medical contexts. Recently the internet world has been transformed by approaches commonly termed 'Web 2.0'. This paper proposes a Web 2.0 model for a healthcare adaptive architecture. The vision includes creating modular, user-composable systems which aim to make all necessary information from multiple internal and external sources available via a platform, for the user to use, arrange, recombine, author, and share at will, using rich interfaces where advisable. Clinicians can create a set of 'widgets' and 'views' which can transform data, reflect their domain knowledge and cater to their needs, using simple drag and drop interfaces without the intervention of programmers. We have built an example system, MedWISE, embodying the user-facing parts of the model. This approach to HIS is expected to have several advantages, including greater suitability to user needs (reflecting clinician rather than programmer concepts and priorities), incorporation of multiple information sources, agile reconfiguration to meet emerging situations and new treatment deployment, capture of user domain expertise and tacit knowledge, efficiencies due to workflow and human-computer interaction improvements, and greater user acceptance. © 2011 European Federation for Medical Informatics.

Method: We introduce a method to systematically analyze a software development process to understand its performance quantitatively, and explain the application of the method on the System Test phase of the Incremental Process. Results: The utilization of the analysis method practically contributed to the implementation which was completed in 8 person-days. An analysis of derived measure values indicated that there was no outlier value in the interval of mean ± 3 standard deviation for the measures. Conclusions: We expect that the method will be more beneficial in capturing the context of the Agile Process and its measures.},

abstract={Telecom Product Maintenance at two Ericsson R&D Centers implemented Kanban. The third level maintenance is performed by the Customer Support Request (CSR) teams and by the design maintenance teams, which are located in two sites. There are separate backlogs for the customer support and for the design maintenance in the primary site and a third backlog for the design maintenance in the secondary site. Pull mindset, team working, team empowerment, and continuous improvement have become part of the everyday activities. Best practices from Scrum have been selected to complement the Kanban implementation. Also, the metrics have been reviewed. The major challenges have been related to the boundary rules, for instance, multi-site working, the platform dependency and the service level agreements but also to the roles and responsibilities. The Kanban boards and the chosen practices have been adjusted as the understanding of Lean has increased. This industry paper presents the journey to Lean product maintenance including the identification of the key success factors that are to some extent generalizable. First, the overall implementation is discussed followed by a deeper description of the implementation both in the CSR handling and in the Fault Handling (design maintenance) including also the experiences from the secondary R&D site. The paper continues by discussing the identified challenges and positive effects. At the end of the paper, the implementation concepts and key success factors are stated. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Utilization of various agile development practices brings demand of short development cycle with stress on early deployment and rapid delivery. Such practices require techniques permitting rapid prototyping of systems, corresponding tests and simulations. One of the well-adopted rapid prototyping techniques is polyglot programming combining multiple, mainly scripting, languages during development of systems. This permits the use of a specialized language for dedicated system concerns and also allows for a continuous change and re-deployment of implementation. Despite the advantages, rapid prototyping with help of polyglot programming is still not well supported in the domain of component-based systems, which makes it difficult to quickly prototype and test these systems. To address the obstacle, the paper describes a general technique for transparent and extensible combining of multiple languages for purpose of rapid prototyping during development of component-based systems with help of advanced component frameworks. © 2011 IEEE.},

The software development community has solved a similar problem (not having enough resources to implement everything that was asked for) by introducing agile development methods, which offer ways of segmenting the overall project, and choosing which parts to allocate resources to. This paper is about how insights from that agile development community can be applied to requirements engineering activities for any (agile or non-agile) development project. Key terms in agile development, such as "working product" and "user story", must be mapped intelligently to terms in requirements engineering - and not simply copied: the "product" of requirements engineering is not the same as the "product" being implemented by developers. © 2011 IEEE.},

It is shown that the current controlled conveyor (CCCII) with switching times less than 3ns is a perfect candidate for implementing frequency-agile filters. The CCCII+ has then been used to design a 2 nd order active bandpass frequency-agile filter operating in current-mode. It has four center frequencies, digitally controlled.

abstract={Many organizations are gradually catching up with the tide of adopting agile practices at workplace, but they seem to be struggling with how to choose the agile practices and mix them into their IT software project development and management. These organizations have already had their own development styles, many of which have adhered to the traditional plan-driven methods such as waterfall. The inherent corporate culture of resisting to change or hesitation to abandon what they have established for a whole new methodology hampers the process change. In this paper, we will review the current state of agile adoption in business organizations and propose a new approach to IT project development and management by blending Scrum, an agile method, into traditional plan-driven project development and management. The management activity involved in Scrum is discussed, the team and meeting composing of Scrum are investigated, the challenges and benefits of applying Scrum in traditional IT project development and management are analyzed, the blending structure is illustrated and discussed, and the iterative process with Scrum and planned process without Scrum are compared. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={The Agile Software Development paradigm has become increasingly popular in the last few years, since it claims lower costs, better productivity, better quality and better business satisfaction. Supply chain management (SCM) is a complex software development project. Owing to its scope and uncertain, complex and unstable requirements, it is not possible to develop it with predictable software development process models. Agile methodologies are targeted toward such kinds of problems that involve change and uncertainty, and are adaptive rather than predictive. How an agile process is introduced will significantly impact the implementation success of the process change. The objective of this paper is to analyze the agile development methodologies and management approach used in developing a complex software project. This further demonstrates how to overcome risks and barriers in each development phase of such complex inventive software projects. It also provides a set of guidelines regarding how the agile methodologies can be adopted, combined and used in these kinds of complex software projects. These findings have implications for software engineers and managers developing software by agile methods. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={The rapid development of software nowadays requires the high speed software product delivery by development teams. In order to deliver the product faster, the development teams make a transformation to their conventional software development lifecycle to agile development method which can enable them towards speedy delivery of software coping with the requirements-change phenomenon. In this scenario, one of the most popular techniques in Agile development is the Scrum methodology which has been criticised in term of its security aspect cycle that ignores the security risk management activity. However, the current practices suggest that security should be considered during all stages of the software development life cycle. In order to address the aforementioned issue, this paper proposes the integration of security principles in development phases using scrum and suggests the element of security backlog that can be used as security features analysis and implementation in scrum phases. © 2011 IEEE.},

In this paper we first describe our research approach and goals. Then we briefly summarize the preliminary results of this ongoing study: we explain how Scrum practices were scaled, as well as discuss the successes and challenges experienced when adopting the agile practices and scaling them, while at the same time growing the project size at a fast pace. Even though this project has been very successful from the business point of view, it has experienced a lot of problems in applying Scrum, especially related to scaling the agile practices. Thus, it seems that adapting Scrum practices to work well in a large distributed setting is challenging. © 2011 IEEE.},

To investigate the longterm acceptance, we conducted a study at a leading insurance company that introduced Scrum in 2007. Using a qualitative research design and the Diffusion of Innovations Theory as a lens for analysis, we gained in-depth insights into factors influencing the acceptance of Scrum. Particularly, developers felt Scrum to be more compatible to their actual working practices. Moreover, they perceived the use of Scrum to deliver numerous relative advantages. However, we also identified possible barriers to acceptance since developers felt both the complexity of Scrum and the required discipline to be higher in comparison with traditional development methodologies. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Cassidian Electronics, a globally operating business unit of EADS, aimed to implement a collaborative portal for its quality management department. After conducting a successful pilot phase producing a prototype for a small number of users it soon became apparent that a large scale roll-out would not be feasible without proper methodological support. As no methodology was available to be used directly, an evaluation process was started and two champion methodologies (PADEM of Fraunhofer Institut and G&K - Großman and Koschek) were identified. A framework was developed to transparently compare the merits of each methodology and G&K selected as the most suitable. This paper presents the selection process as well as the case study describing the adaption mechanism and subsequent application of G&K for the roll-out of a large scale distributed collaboration portal in a high quality environment. A key lesson learned is the strong benefit of an agile method for portal implementations and rollouts to ensure high user satisfaction and technology acceptance leading to measurable financial benefits.},

abstract={Agile methods gain the upper hand over traditional software development methods when it comes to constant customer participation, customer satisfaction with early project delivery and acceptance of requirement changes at any stage of software development life cycle. So the practice of agile methods has been increasing in recent years. Some of the well-known agile methods that are in practice today are Adaptive Software Development, Feature Driven Development, Scrum, eXtreme Programming. A comparison among different agile methods helps managers who need to introduce agility into their organization by providing a thorough knowledge on different features and aspects of the agile methods. By comparing different agile methods, managers can easily choose the agile method that best suites his project requirements and organizational characteristics. Different comparison techniques to compare agile methods were introduced in recent years by researchers. We have compared the agile methods Adaptive Software Development and Feature Driven Development in order to evaluate their degree of agility and coverage degree with respect to the two Knowledge Areas of SWEBOK, (1) Software Requirements, (2) Software Construction. The result of our comparison shows that Adaptive Software Development mainly differs from Feature Driven Development because there are no predefined techniques or specific practices that are meant to be followed in Adaptive Software Development. Feature Driven Development has some predefined techniques or practices that are to be followed during software development. The principle of Adaptive Software Development is to focus more on results rather than steps to achieve that result. A technique is only implemented if it is necessary to get the best output in Adaptive Software Development. © 2011 IEEE.},

Nevertheless, they require a significant capacity of absorbing new set of skills, knowledge and mindset changing. When using agile methods IS developers are faced with a challenge to quickly assimilate the mindset of these new methods and develop the ability to recognize information and apply it in context. This paper reports on two ex-post ISD project implementation. We integrate a central construct in the dynamic capability theory - absorptive capacity to explain agile method adoption and usage. The findings show that absorptive capacity, indeed, plays an important role in adopting and using agile method-Extreme Programming model. The implications of these findings for both researchers and practitioners are discussed. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Agile project management continues to gain a widening and enthusiastic following. Agile methods can achieve a high level of satisfaction among all project stakeholders (users, customers, business managers, developers, and project managers) in terms of productivity, product quality, cost containment, time-tomarket, and overall morale. Success with agile requires focus on requirements and design as a continuous discovery process, posing challenges for practitioners of more traditional project management both in terms of method adoption and sustained commitment. Thriving Systems Theory clarifies the appeal of agile project structure and processes, helps project teams determine and achieve the optimal portfolio of quality characteristics, and better articulate their value to all stakeholders. Thriving Systems Theory is an emerging framework of systems design quality that translates the research of design pattern patriarch Christopher Alexander on physical architecture design quality into the domain of systems engineering. The satisfaction achieved through agile methods is explained by Thriving Systems Theory's fifteen choice properties of systems design quality. We demonstrate by identifying the manifestation of the choice properties in SCRUM, an exemplar of agile software project management. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In Agile Software Development (ASD), stakeholders use stories to stimulate conversations that create and convey understanding of software requirements. Some authors have argued that ASD methods have limited applicability to large-scale projects because agile stories are not sufficient to capture the complexities of up-front design. This paper reports a 2.5-year field study of how an ASD team for a complex software system adapted the user story concept and the Scrum approach. The team sought to create a convention for representing agile stories which could capture the complexities of the system requirements without burdening the team with unneeded documentation. They developed eight different ways to represent a story. The core representation of the approach was called a HyperEpic, a structured collection of closely-related HyperStories. HyperEpics required 90-99% fewer words than conventional specifications. Because of their dense form, Hyper-epics were not useful for other phases in the design/build processes. The team evolved a design/build work practice that proceeded in stages. In each stage, stories underwent a one or more transformations. Each transformation represented stories differently to create varied kinds of understandings among different stakeholder sets. The team was able to gain the benefits of ASD - faster development cycles, less documentation, rapid adaptation to insights and conditions. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Advanced marine modeling and design systems and tools can provide significant returns on investment in the form of more standardized deliverables, more rules-based design automation, and more customization to enable process innovation. These benefits can be achieved through the adoption of a technology, such as SmartMarine 3D, which offers a rule-driven solution for streamlining the design process. Working with an organization's in-house experts, familiar with the design and production practices, an implementation plan can be created to automate the most common modeling practices. Depending on the background of the in-house domain experts and/or the technology, design experts may require some amount of time and training using the new technology before sufficient knowledge and skills can be achieved - ultimately slipping the start of the customization efforts, prolonging the implementation timeframe, and delaying the point where the return on investment begins to generate savings. Since the creation of a rule driven solution involves some sort of "programming" , it is logical to look to the software development community for techniques and methods to do this work in an effective and efficient manner. Utilizing standard Agile programming methodologies, teams are created with individuals that fulfill roles such as subject matter expert, developer, product owner, documentation specialist, and tester. These knowledge resources are collocated and work on prioritized backlog items with known business values for fixed length cycles with identified Conditions of Satisfaction. In this paper, we will discuss the pros and cons of this approach and summarize the experience of "lessons learned" through an actual implementation project, which includes development of customized rules and catalog content for the modeling, detailing, and production of marine vessels. ©2011: The Royal Institution of Naval Architects.},

abstract={Because of our increasingly technology-enabled society, computing-supported interactions are growing in both number and complexity. As a result, visual communication designers are now required to align themselves closely with computer science engineers. To create truly useful and successful software applications, a wide variety of specialties is now necessary. For the foreseeable future, design's success will be closely tied to the success of our computer science colleagues. The recent proliferation of Agile environments has helped establish a dialogue between the fields. However, a lack of educational exposure to these collaborative environments can cause friction between the roles, ultimately affecting productivity in the professional arena. Open dialogue needs to be introduced earlier to allow students to practice working together towards a common goal. In an attempt to start defining this critical space, graduate students from the Department of Design at The Ohio State University worked as consultants for development teams within two capstone courses in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. Out of observations, surveys and interviews during the Autumn 2010 Quarter, recommendations were established to improve upon the traditional educational experience. These recommendations were used to define a new model of interaction for the students, now placing an emphasis on interdependency. In this redesigned classroom environment, students will now be required to work closely to integrate multidisciplinary perspectives into their solutions. By giving students the opportunity to work interdependently in an academic environment, institutions will help generate professionals that are prepared to work more integratively after graduation.},

A transfer control system is conducted by HSA (Hybrid Shape Approach) using STT (Straight Transfer Transformation) method and its effectiveness in suppressing the sway of both ship and load was confirmed by the simulation analysis. A shipboard crane operational training system which we call virtual coach teaching system, is also presented, in order to shorten the training period of amateur operators. The controlled inputs generated from HSA controller which are utilized as the ideal commands are then converted to drive a newly built teaching interface. Subjects are physically coached through the ideal motion of joystick by placing their hand on the teaching interface, thus giving them a kinesthetic understanding on how to transfer a load without exciting the sway of both the ship and load. Performance of subjects was measured in terms of transfer time by conducting an experiment using a newly built virtual driving simulator.

abstract={Ubiquitous tele-care (u-Telecare) is a migration from tele-health and mobile health (m-Health) for continuous care. The u-Telecare is quite adaptable in the user environment which owns specific attributes, such as telecommunication, highly mobility, and medical care. Based on the preliminary survey and evaluation, some innovative software applications can support mobile nursing carts (MNC) for nurses, handheld devices for physicians, hospice care for terminal cancer patients, and home care devices for chronic diabetic patients. The research findings discovered that software defined radio (SDR) is a feasible solution and can be implemented for handling the physical layer of the multi-wireless communication standards. In this paper, we propose an ubiquitous seamless MNC (u-SMNC), which provides agile and high quality software focusing on the design and application implementation in order to supply an experimental software platform that allows MNCs and physician's handheld devices. © 2011 IEEE.},

This paper proposes a lightweight approach for service-oriented system development based on MDA philosophy. The method suggest to model the domain with a domain specific modeling language and then map the domain model to platform independent model which is built with UML. The platform independent model can be transformed to platform specific models described by OWL-S and WS-BPEL. A domain ontology is defined to provide domain knowledge for semantic annotation through the whole process. An instance is provided to illustrate the approach, including the modeling and transforming models from CIM to PSM.

abstract={With the number of prescriptions rising nationally each year, it is required that web-based technology will fully embraced in the pharmacy industry as an aid to quality-assuring prescribing processes. Electronic prescribing (ePrescribing) has the ability not only to streamline the prescription writing process, but also to reduce the number of errors that may be incurred with handwritten prescriptions. The adoption of ePrescribing nationwide through an ePrescribing system premises active participation of users who are familiar with the cooperative and collaborative nature of healthcare delivery. Thus, there is a need for reusable, flexible, agile and adaptable training content with the objective to enable healthcare professionals instill their knowledge and expertise in the ePrescribing process. To this end, social software, such as a wiki, could be used as it supports cooperation and collaboration anytime, anywhere, combined with semantic web technology that enables structuring pieces of information for easy retrieval, reuse and exchange between different systems and tools. In this paper a semantic wiki is presented as a means for developing training material for healthcare providers regarding ePrescribing process.

abstract={The rise of Software as a Service (SaaS) platforms is driven by the current trend towards customer-oriented, agile and scalable service provisioning. Customers' demand for highly specialized services can mostly not be met by a single provider that offers a holistic solution but by a consortium of providers that cooperate. In order to enable the combination of services and hence, the collaboration between different service providers, technical challenges like the compatibility of interfaces have to be dealt with. In addition, economic issues concerning profit, reliability and risk of service failure have to be taken into consideration. A model of Agreement Networks (ANs) is presented that illustrate the legal bindings that are established or under negotiation between service providers and a methodology is introduced that supports providers in ANs to decide on the establishment of a combination of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) that incurs the lowest risk of SLA violation. Finally, a benchmark for risk-based decisions is derived that serves to evaluate the efficiency of the choice. The impact of the available amount of monitoring data on the decision is investigated and a minimal amount of 100 observations for each SLA combination is suggested.},

abstract={Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is becoming a mainstream approach for designing and integrating enterprise applications. This paper presents a methodology for migration of legacy applications and services to Service-Oriented Architecture. In order to upgrade existing applications and services to SOA, the methodology should be used in a consistent functional and technological manner. In addition, we have proposed a specific SOA migration approach based on multi-tier architecture. This architecture brings clear differentiation of logical and technical components, allowing business process to be defined in a flexible and agile manner. The architecture highlights position and role of legacy application, fine and coarse grained services with the respect to their role in the business process. As a critical component in the overall architecture, Enterprise Service Bus acts as mediation and virtualization layer helping to separate business and logical view of the process from its technological implementation and reduce dependencies. Our approach is based on analysis of the legacy software in order to identify the business and presentation logic components. The next step is to redesign the legacy code by isolating the business logic and performing code stripping. Finally coarse-grained and loosely coupled SOA services in the medium and upper layer are created in order to achieve the benefits of SOA architecture. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={The integrated circuit industry continues to progress rapidly deepening the gap in between the technological break-throughs and the electronic design automation industry. This gap is even more problematic in the context of physical design, the last automation level between applications and the technology. The challenges of meeting the physical and performance constraints necessitate innovation at the algorithmic level, and at the methodological level. This study presents a methodological approach to physical design automation relying on model-driven engineering. Relying on the flexibility, and adaptability of the Smalltalk environment we propose an agile framework enabling fast physical design tool-flow prototyping. We illustrate our approach by using the Madeo FPGA toolkit as a legacy codebase that is incrementally changed to adopt this modeldriven development strategy. Some pragmatic achievements are presented to illustrate the principal axes of this approach: algorithmic improvements through plug-and-play routines, domain-model extension for emerging technologies, as well as model evolution toward a meta-described environment.

abstract={Context is information that describes the situations in which computing, social and physical interactions take place. The complexity and scope of context information available for utilization by context-consuming applications, such as those executing on smart mobile devices, sensing and tracking platforms, etc. is growing with the increased integration of digital artifacts in smart environments. Similarly, the uptake of Cloud computing has significantly influenced the traditional information processing and infrastructure provision models by offering an agile, scalable and cost effective computing paradigm. This is leading to the adoption of Cloud-based solutions for the pervasive and ubiquitous environments; however, there are significant challenges that need to be overcome before its exploitation by real world applications and users. The context information consumed and produced by the applications and devices needs to be represented, disseminated, processed and consumed by numerous components in a context-aware Cloud system. Significant amount of context consumption, production and processing takes place on devices and there is limited or no support for collaborative modeling, persistence and processing between the device-Cloud ecosystems. In this paper we propose an environment for context processing in a Cloud-based distributed infrastructure that offloads complex context processing from the applications and devices. An experimental analysis of complexity based context-processing categories has been carried out to establish the processing-load boundary. The results demonstrate that the proposed collaborative device-Cloud infrastructure provides significant performance and energy conservation benefits for mobile devices and applications. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Two new species of Swima, a recently established genus of annelid worms, are introduced, one from deep water off the North American West Coast and the other from the Philippines. The acrocirrid genus now contains three named species, Swima bombiviridis, Swima fulgida sp. nov., and Swima tawitawiensis sp. nov. Swima are holopelagic, occurring only in the water column, and thus far have only been observed below 2700 m. The worms are relatively large, sometimes reaching over 30 mm in length and 5 mm in width. They have gelatinous bodies and fans of long swimming chaetae, which are flattened into paddles in S. tawitawiensis sp. nov. Members of Swima are distinguished from other swimming acrocirrids by their transparent bodies, single medial subulate branchiae, and simple nuchal organs that do not skirt the bases of lateral subulate branchiae. Swima fulgida sp. nov. is distinguished from other members of the genus by its darkly pigmented anterior gut, whereas S. tawitawiensis sp. nov. is distinguished by possessing three subulate head appendages instead of just one and by the shape of its noto- and neurochaetae. Swima species possess four pairs of elliptical, transformed segmental branchiae that produce green bioluminescence when autotomized. These 'bombs' were observed in various states of regeneration on a single individual. Swima are neutrally buoyant, often observed hanging immobile in the water column, and are active, agile swimmers. Although not previously documented in the literature, these worms are not rare in the deep water column.

abstract={Wide area networks of increasing end-to-end capacity and capability are vital for every phase of high energy physicists' work. Our bandwidth usage, and the typical capacity of the major national backbones and intercontinental links used by our field have progressed by a factor of several hundred times over the past decade. With the opening of the LHC era in 2009-10 and the prospects for discoveries in the upcoming LHC run, the outlook is for a continuation or an acceleration of these trends using next generation networks over the next few years. Responding to the need to rapidly distribute and access datasets of tens to hundreds of terabytes drawn from multi-petabyte data stores, high energy physicists working with network engineers and computer scientists are learning to use long range networks effectively on an increasing scale, and aggregate flows reaching the 100 Gbps range have been observed. The progress of the LHC, and the unprecedented ability of the experiments to produce results rapidly using worldwide distributed data processing and analysis has sparked major, emerging changes in the LHC Computing Models, which are moving from the classic hierarchical model designed a decade ago to more agile peer-to-peer-like models that make more effective use of the resources at Tier2 and Tier3 sites located throughout the world. A new requirements working group has gauged the needs of Tier2 centers, and charged the LHCOPN group that runs the network interconnecting the LHC Tierls with designing a new architecture interconnecting the Tier2s. As seen from the perspective of ICFA's Standing Committee on Inter-regional Connectivity (SCIC), the Digital Divide that separates physicists in several regions of the developing world from those in the developed world remains acute, although many countries have made major advances through the rapid installation of modern network infrastructures. A case in point is Africa, where a new round of undersea cables promises to transform the continent.},

abstract={Agile development methods are being recognized as popular and efficient approaches to the development of software systems that have features such as a short delivery period and unclear requirements. They emphasize customer satisfaction, fast response to changes, and release in less time. According to a recent survey, SCRUM is one of the most popular methods that are currently being used. Some backlogs, especially high priority backlogs that are functional requirements of customers, are developed repeatedly at each sprint period. Despite the known advantages of SCRUM, however, its backlogs focus only on functional features. Thus, it is difficult to effectively reflect the softwares quality attributes. As known, the failure of a software project is caused by the non-satisfaction not of functional features but of quality attributes, such as performance, usability, and reliability. This paper introduces the ACRUM1 that is a quality attribute driven agile development method. The main characteristic of the proposed solution is that it is derived from values and practices of SCRUM to be compatible with the SCRUM process and to keep its agility intact. The effect of ACRUM was evaluated through an agile process evaluation checklist and applying it into a commercial project of Samsung Electronics. The results showed that ACRUM is more efficient than the legacy agile development process. © 2011 IEEE.},

This paper first introduces a design method for event-driven business processes based on an integrative event ontology. This method is confronted with communication-oriented approaches from the Language/Action Perspectiv (LAP). It is shown that a combination is possible and in fact beneficial. However, a generalization of the traditional LAP approach is needed. © 2011 ACM.},

This solution brings several difficulties, such as interference with the operation of applications. To minimize these difficulties, in this paper we present an asynchronous approach to keep these schemas updated.

abstract={Context: Extreme Programming (XP) is one of the most popular agile software development methodologies. XP is defined as a consistent set of values and practices designed to work well together, but lacks practices for project management and especially for supporting the customer role. The customer representative is constantly under pressure and may experience difficulties in foreseeing the adequacy of a release plan. Objective: To assist release planning in XP by structuring the planning problem and providing an optimization model that suggests a suitable release plan. Method: We develop an optimization model that generates a release plan taking into account story size, business value, possible precedence relations, themes, and uncertainty in velocity prediction. The running-time feasibility is established through computational tests. In addition, we provide a practical heuristic approach to velocity estimation. Results: Computational tests show that problems with up to six themes and 50 stories can be solved exactly. An example provides insight into uncertainties affecting velocity, and indicates that the model can be applied in practice. Conclusion: An optimization model can be used in practice to enable the customer representative to take more informed decisions faster. This can help adopting XP in projects where plan-driven approaches have traditionally been used. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Purpose: This case aims to describe the practices of Salesforce.com, one of the most successful examples of a company transitioning from traditional management to radical management. Design/methodology/approach: The article explores the factors that made the implementation successful and identifies the pitfalls that were avoided. Salesforce.com provides on-demand services for customer-relationship management. Findings: Salesforce.com has had more spectacular results than most other companies that have adopted the radical management principles of Scrum. Research limitations/implications: Over the past five years Salesforce.com has delivered a 41 percent annual return to shareholders. This extraordinary performance - in fact, an example of an innovation turnaround - occurred after the firm instituted a set of radical practices that make it a model for business seeking to grow though continuous innovation. Practical implications: The leadership at Salesforce.com saw that if a radically different approach to management were to be introduced in one part of the organization, there would be a tension at the interface between the part of the company still doing traditional management and the part managing work in the new way. So they opted to go all out with change right across the whole organization. Originality/value: What made Salesforce.com different is that when it innovativeness was threatened it adopted a radically different way of managing work. It implemented a set of agile, customer-driven, outcome-oriented, iterative management practices known in software development as Scrum. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

This study compares reasons for change as well as change practices in interorganizational relationships in construction and information technology. Sixteen contractual relationships have been studied through a questionnaire and interview survey conducted among both clients and providers. Project-type relations are contrasted with more continuous service support contracts. More than their providers, clients tend to ascribe high change frequencies to an increase in technical understanding during projects. Early provider participation is associated with lower change frequencies, while the strength of incentives is less influential. The ease of transforming changes into new projects varies between technologies. Irreversibility is important, as well as relations between pre-investigations and the successive revealing of initial conditions, together with the life-cycle of formal and informal communication. Findings can be used for transfer of agile practices. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The software applications running as cloud SaaS are targeted on different platforms. The constantly evolving software technologies may result in the obsolescence of the legacy applications. It, therefore, becomes an essential requisite to adopt a software development methodology that could alleviate the undesirable effects of technology change. The Model Driven Architecture (MDA) approach becomes the obvious choice where the models drive the software development process. These models are defined at different levels of abstraction; and automated tools are used for model-to-model and model-to-code transformations between the levels. In this paper, the authors illustrate an MDA-based approach for developing cloud software applications making them more robust, flexible and agile, in the wake of changing technologies. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

However, because of their traditional process models, these methodologies delay the generation of application prototypes until all design aspects (e.g. domain and navigation) are completed. These aspects are crucial for developers but not for customers, who are interested in viewing parts of the application running as early as possible. In this paper we introduce a novel model driven approach that starts from user interface specifications, using mockups to derive concrete presentation implementations - we call it Mockup-Driven Development or just MockupDD. Then, by using lightweight enrichments and applying heuristics over these models, we show how we obtain navigation and content specifications in the context of different MDWE methods. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

Also the high failure rate the system implementation is famous as well. According to [1], ERP systems could achieve efficient business performance by enabling a standardized business process design, but at a cost of flexibility in operations. However, enterprise 2.0 supports flexible business process management, informal and less structured interactions [3],[4],[21]. Traditional researcher claimed efficiency and flexibility may seem incompatible in that they are different business objectives and may exist in different organizational environments. However, the paper will break traditional norms that combine ERP and enterprise 2.0 in a single enterprise to improve both efficient and flexible operations simultaneously. Based on the multiple cases studies, four cases presented different attitudes on usage ERP systems and enterprise social systems. Based on socio-technical theory, the paper presents in-depth analysis benefits of combination ERP with enterprise 2.0 for these firms. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Agile methods emerge as an alternative to improve quality and performance in software development processes. However, as agile methods are essentially focused on human aspects, their application in companies depends mostly on their adequacy to the current organizational culture. This study explores the view of the organizational culture in three levels as a theoretical framework to allow early detection of problems, which could jeopardize the adoption of agile methods by a company. This article points out that many facilitators or obstacles to the adoption of an agile method can be hidden in the lower levels of the organizational culture. Additionally, the article shows that a superficial analysis of those issues can lead to a miscomprehension about the possibility of applying an agile method in a software company. This article also evidences that the interpretation of the levels of organizational culture improves the understanding of how an agile culture should be established.

abstract={Digitization of instrumentation and communications systems has encouraged a digitally controlled method of generating multiple frequencies from a reference frequency source called Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS). DDS systems are characterized by fast switching, fine frequency discrimination, low phase noise, and transient-free frequency changes. Frequency changes are phase continuous, which is desirable in phase or frequency modulation. The fast frequency switching is useful in frequency-agile and spread spectrum systems. Algorithms used in communication technology require the computation of trigonometric functions, coordinate transformations, vector rotations, or hyperbolic rotations. The coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC) is a rotation-based arithmetic computing algorithm which has found many important applications. CORDIC is not the fastest way to perform multiplications or to compute algorithms and exponentials, but, since the same algorithm enables the computation of most mathematical functions using basic operations of the form (a b) 2 i, it is attractive for hardware implementations. The paper aims at introducing the concept of DDS and briefly cover the various major phase to amplitude conversion techniques used before reaching to the CORDIC algorithm. It also aims to present a proof of concept of the CORDIC algorithm by comparing the results obtained by simulating the CORDIC algorithm in VHDL &amp; the theoretical values. © 2011 IEEE.},

We found some issues, and while working on this paper discovered that others have found similar patterns, most notably Linda Rising in her book "Fearless Change" ii. Obstacles we found include the necessity to obtain and maintain support of leadership, the influence of tooling on the implementation, and the need to go step-by-step: get agile skills in teams before attempting to change the full Software Development Life Cycle. We had great results from made-to-measure training of the teams around the globe, from finding a pace-maker process in the development process, and from the support of people who lead actual development programs. © 2011 IEEE.},

Then, after deciding to learn more about a certain offering, Scrum training, the teams found a way to take more control over this process. In the fall of 2010, the iSense sales and account management teams decided to adopt Scrum internally as their best practice. Scrum transformed the random process, revealing early indicators related to final sales results, and showed that the direct causes for closing a deal could be detected and controlled. Once it became possible to predict and influence final order intake and sales numbers, the sales teams used early predictive indicators to proactively control their work. With the sales processes under better control, the teams could improve continuously and have more fun at work. Strategically implementing Scrum into sales and account management has lead to escalating revenue and a sustainable competitive advantage. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper we investigate agile team perceptions of factors impacting their productivity. Within this overall goal we also investigate which productivity concept was adopted by the agile teams studied. We here conducted two case studies in the industry and analyzed data from two projects that we followed for six months. From the perspective of agile team members the three most perceived factors impacting on their productivity were appropriate team composition and allocation external dependencies and staff turnover. Teams also mentioned pair programming and collocation as agile practices that impact productivity. As a secondary finding most team members did not share the same understanding of the concept of productivity. While some known factors still impact agile team productivity new factors emerged from the interviews as potential productivity factors impacting agile teams.© 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={A supply chain (SC) is a network of supplier, factories, warehouse, distribution centers, retailers, and customers, through which raw materials are acquired, transformed, produced, and delivered to the customers. As a complex network of suppliers, factories, warehouses, distributors, and retailers, the highly effective and efficient operations of a SC depend on the speedily moving of information flows and material flows. The rapid advances in information technology (IT) have always resulted in innovation, such as the Internet, that is terms of its potential as a channel for collecting, transmitting and storing information. As is well-known, the emergence of Internet has made a significant impact on the rapid growth of Internet-based information transfer between companies, their suppliers, and their customers. The Internet has emerged as an effective means of driving information integration and sharing for a supply chain, as well as has supported various coordination mechanisms across a supply chain. To make decisions promptly and to accelerate material flows via the integration and sharing of information flows improve the effectiveness and efficiency of a supply chain execution. However there exists a gap between the material flows and the information flows in a supply chain because of the information flows always can not reflect the wave of material flows real-timely, as well as it is impossible to understand the process of a supply chain execution real-timely. Being the next generation network of the Internet, the Internet of Things (IoT), which is a comprehensive extension of the Internet and also can achieve the pervasive connections between objects (things) and objects (things), information automotive collecting and real-time processing, as well as ubiquitous computing, close the gap between objects in the material world and their representation in information systems. It is able to real-timely monitor the process of a supply chain execution and also to further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of supply chain over the IoT. In this paper, the authors mainly discuss the characteristics of the IoT and enabling technologies, and explore the distributed architecture of SCM over the IoT. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Background: In bioinformatics projects, scientific workflow systems are widely used to manage computational procedures. Full-featured workflow systems have been proposed to fulfil the demand for workflow management. However, such systems tend to be over-weighted for actual bioinformatics practices. We realize that quick deployment of cutting-edge software implementing advanced algorithms and data formats, and continuous adaptation to changes in computational resources and the environment are often prioritized in scientific workflow management. These features have a greater affinity with the agile software development method through iterative development phases after trial and error. Here, we show the application of a scientific workflow system Pwrake to bioinformatics workflows. Pwrake is a parallel workflow extension of Ruby's standard build tool Rake, the flexibility of which has been demonstrated in the astronomy domain. Therefore, we hypothesize that Pwrake also has advantages in actual bioinformatics workflows. Findings. We implemented the Pwrake workflows to process next generation sequencing data using the Genomic Analysis Toolkit (GATK) and Dindel. GATK and Dindel workflows are typical examples of sequential and parallel workflows, respectively. We found that in practice, actual scientific workflow development iterates over two phases, the workflow definition phase and the parameter adjustment phase. We introduced separate workflow definitions to help focus on each of the two developmental phases, as well as helper methods to simplify the descriptions. This approach increased iterative development efficiency. Moreover, we implemented combined workflows to demonstrate modularity of the GATK and Dindel workflows. Conclusions: Pwrake enables agile management of scientific workflows in the bioinformatics domain. The internal domain specific language design built on Ruby gives the flexibility of rakefiles for writing scientific workflows. Furthermore, readability and maintainability of rakefiles may facilitate sharing workflows among the scientific community. Workflows for GATK and Dindel are available at http://github.com/misshie/Workflows. © 2011Mishima et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Reliability is a systematic work, and it must be embedded in the product development process to improve the inherent reliability, so a suitable reliability work flow is very important. Meanwhile, technical details are crucial to the achievement of reliability work, and multidisciplinary knowledge is generally used to direct or audit the design specifics. Therefore, the reliability work has two characteristics: systematic and technical. On the basis of the waterfall model of product development, a modified reliability work flow was introduced, which was established and embedded in the integrated product development model. In this work flow, we ensure the final achievement by controlling some key steps, such as the input of reliability requirement, system and sub-system level reliability design, key module and device reliability testing, evaluation and auditing, and etc. We guarantee the quality of every steps work by defining and regularizing the role responsibilities and work details, thus improve the overall output of reliability work. In order to enhance its operational characteristic, some work was modified or simplified according to the company situation. For example, we emphasize reliability requirements must have two key characteristics: quantitative and decomposable. After near two years implementation, the defects of new products reduced by 10%, and the customer satisfaction increased form 85% to 90%, which shows that this work flow is suitable to our company. It can be expected reasonably that the reliability work flow will be more effective and robust by further modification and standardization as time goes, and the products reliability level will be more and more higher. © 2011 IEEE.},

Knowledge is considered as the main competitive asset of the organization. One of the objectives of knowledge management (KM) is to improve productivity by effective knowledge sharing and transfer. Agile software development has put a new focus on the question of how to share knowledge among members of software development teams. In contrast to heavy-weight, document-centric approaches, agile approaches rely on face-to-face communication for knowledge transfer. Pair programming is one such practice with the idea to share the work specific knowledge across the development teams through pair rotation. This paper introduces work on developing a framework for capturing the tacit knowledge shared among the practitioners of agile software development methodologies. This approach facilitates the organizational learning process by capturing and maintaining the necessary knowledge. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Lean methodologies are adopted into the information technology (IT) industry to eliminate waste and maximise business value to the customers. The global services models today provide ample scope to apply lean practices to IT services delivery and thereby to create robust partnerships between the vendors and the customers. The purpose of this paper is to identify some of the best practices in lean methodology as applicable to the IT service delivery and to exemplify the implementation in the context of a case study. The best practices mentioned in the paper are confined to our prioritisation of the observations and to identify the candidates that inject waste into the operations. A case study approach has been adopted to summarise the understanding and findings of our research. Many areas that inject waste into the IT services have been highlighted with supporting recommendations to eliminate such non-value added work. Copyright © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={At the IBM Almaden Research Center, we havebeen working with other divisions of IBM, offering Software Development as a Service (SDaaS). We work with our colleagues to understand their business and pain points, and then leverage that knowledge to build an application that at least meets, but ideally exceeds their needs. in our experience, applications built in the mode of Software Development as a Service have the following characteristics. There is a single client that owns the program requirements; the requirements are not fully formed; and, the software is at least partly, if not completely, custom. With many decades of software development experience in our group, we have used many different techniques for conducting software projects. in SDaaS, the style of interaction between the client team and the development team is a natural fit for Agile Software Development methods. Although our conditions do not fit the ideal Agile Software Development project profile, we have consistently experienced significant gains from taking the approach of iterative and incremental development. We have used the Waterfall, or plan-based, method many times for past projects, and we have consistently paid a significant price for the "Big Design Up Front" problems that go with that type of schedule. Although agile methods have consistently outperformed other methods in the early stages of a project, they do less well as the application program grows and the project matures. Once an application is in production and has an established user base, the emphasis of the client and development teams change from fast, easy and elegant feature additions to stability, release planning and maintenance. The imposition of a fixed schedule naturally transitions the overall project management into a plan-based model. However, we came to realize that agile methods still play an essential role, even when the overall project has matured to a steady state and is managed in a planbased fashion. When developing a new program requirement, unless it is completely understood (i.e. all aspects and expected results documented), then it must go through an agile prototyping phase in order for it to be properly developed and scheduled. That agile prototyping phase is still bound inside a plan-based schedule, but that leaves room for iteration and innovation that we would not otherwise have in a fixed schedule. in this paper, we examine the various forces that influence both the client and development organizations that are engaged in Software Development as a Service. Using several projects from our past as examples, we show that the level of program technology and requirement understanding determines which development method will be more successful. Plan-based methods will work if all aspects of the project are known and there are minimal variables. Otherwise, our experience shows that an Agile Development model is likely to be the best choice for the beginning of a project. Once a project reaches steady state, with production releases, then a hybrid model works best, where agile methods are used to prototype new features, but bounded inside of a plan-based schedule. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Student project teams are an integral part of the software engineering curriculum. This paper reports on the classroom experiences of student teams developing Android applications using Scrum. The course in study is a software engineering undergraduate elective in Agile Software Development which used Android mobile phones donated by Google as the development environment for student teams to learn and practice Scrum. Scrum is an agile project management framework increasingly being adopted in the development of commercial software products. When used in an academic setting it provides the opportunity to introduce and practice project management skills involving planning, estimation, tracking and identifying opportunities for continuous process improvement. As the ideal number of team members on a Scrum project is 5-9 developers, Scrum maps well from a size perspective for the typical student team collaborating on a course or capstone project. While Scrum has specific project roles and ceremonies, it is intentionally non-prescriptive on the development practices to be used in the execution of the project. In a software development project these practices are realized in the familiar software engineering life-cycles activities of requirements-analysis-design-code-testdeploy. In an Agile process these activities occur in more tightly wound incremental and iterative time boxes. Agile has also introduced variations on existing software development practices such as test first design or the frontloading of testing activities early in the development life-cycle. The paper addresses the benefits and limitations of the adoption of Scrum by a student project team and proposes recommendations for a pragmatic process framework - the Student Scrum - based on the contributions of agile processes and practices. © 2011 American Society for Engineering Education.},

abstract={A continual debate surrounds the effectiveness of agile software development practices. Some organizations adopt agile practices to become more competitive, improve processes, and reduce costs. Other organizations are skeptical about whether agile development is beneficial. Large organizations face an additional challenge in integrating agile practices with existing standards and business processes. To examine the effects of agile development practices in large organizations, we review and integrate scientific literature and theory on agile software development. We further organize our theory and observations into a framework with guidelines for large organizations considering agile methodologies. Based on this framework, we present recommendations that suggest ways large organizations with established processes can successfully implement agile practices. Our analysis of the literature and theory provides new insight for researchers of agile software development and assists practitioners in determining how to adopt agile development in their organizations.},

Two notable trends are model-based testing as well as capture and replay technique. In this contribution we present an approach which allows a meaningful combination of both in order to be able to derive fully executable test cases from usage-models and to keep them highly maintainable in a SCRUM process. We first define a set of re-useable test steps by means of a capture and replay tool (TAISpy). Next, we show how it is possible to directly integrate these test steps into the usage models of a GUI and subsequently to generate executable test cases from them without further refinement or transformation to other formats. General idea, implemented architecture, tool chain and, finally, a case study are presented. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={The globalization of information technology and the improvement of telecommunication facilities have facilitated software development business processes worldwide. Despite this increasingly popular trend, the initial expectations of the cost reductions of offshore outsourcing have not been realized. Many software development companies are facing difficulties caused by many hidden costs, including translation efforts in language gap, transition risks, learning needs, communication overheads, setup times, ramping up durations, scope creeps, etc. In this paper, we propose an approach to improving knowledge sharing in global software development. In addition, the trend of software development methodology has been changing to iterative and agile style from the classic waterfall model. In iterative and agile software developments, requirement specification, coding, testing, are mainly interested in a relatively short term. The rationale of this change came from the higher software quality and higher customer satisfaction. Iterative process can involve customers and developers into its software development mode carefully and deeply. One of the challenges is to apply an iterative or agile development model into global software developments. The main problem is such iterative and agile process might need the tremendous number of communications and documents for collaboration because of iteration. Thus, software collaboration tools will be valuable for such situations in global software developments. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

This paper reports in detail on one observational study of a mature Scrum team in a large organization, and their interactions with the UX designers working on the same project. The evidence from our study shows that Agile development and UX design practice is not explained by rationalized accounts dealing with processes or techniques. Instead, understanding practice requires examining the wider organizational setting in which the Agile developers and UX designers are embedded. Our account focuses on the situatedness of the work by making reference to values and assumptions in the organizational setting, and the consequences that those values and assumptions had for practice. In this organizational setting, cooperation between the Agile developers and UX designers was achieved through ongoing articulation work by the developers, who were compelled to engage a culturally distinct UX design division. Based on this study, insights into culture, self-organization and purposeful work highlight significant implications for practice. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={High peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) is one of the major issues in practical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmissions. Due to high PAPR and power amplifier nonlinearity, it is typical to observe an increase in the out-of-band (OOB) interference caused by the OFDM transmissions and the bit-error rate at the receiver. The dynamic spectrum access system in this demonstration applies PAPR reduction to frequency-agile and bandwidth-adaptive OFDM transmissions, without sending any side information to the receivers. Partial transmission sequences (PTS) are adopted for PAPR reduction to be compatible with the cyclostationary signatures, embedded into OFDM waveforms for frequency acquisition and bandwidth estimation. In addition, by rotating the signal constellation properly, there is no need to send PTS-related side information to the receivers. The demonstration system is built upon the highly flexible Iris software radio platform, which is capable of providing the runtime reconfigurability needed. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Software processes have an important role to play in realizing organizational strategies. When a software organization is about to decide on the adoption of a new process, it should have a clear understanding of its own strategic objectives, as well as the potentials of the new method in supporting or hindering its strategic plan. From this perspective, a successful process adoption initiative is one which provides maximum support to the strategic objectives of an organization while producing a minimum of adverse effects. This paper introduces the concept of Strategically Balanced Process Adoption (SBPA) for anticipating and monitoring the strategic impacts of a new process before and after its adoption. A set of techniques are proposed for the realization of SBPA, which are based on a repository of method fragments, introduced in an earlier ICSP paper. The proposed techniques are deployed in an industrial experience, where the subject organization was about to adopt a custom-designed agile process. The proposed techniques of SBPA helped the subject organization to better design the to-be process, with improved control over its enactment. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={With the increasingly seamless integration of geospatial intelligence into mainstream IT solutions and the rise of the "Geospatial Web", the need for geoinformatics standards is ever more critical. Geoinformatics standards detail the engineering aspects (and rules) capturing common agreements for implementing an interface or encoding that applies to specific geospatial interoperability problems. Standards from organizations such as ISO and the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) enable users to more freely exchange and apply geospatial information, applications and services across networks, platforms and products. This panel is about the emerging agile processes behind the development of such standards in the geoinformatics field, specifically complementing the traditional formal consensus processes as a way to keep up with rapid technology changes, and the immediate needs for these standards in a wide range of domains. Agile processes are based on iterative, incremental and collaborative development, and typically deliver increased value, higher adaptability and reduced risk levels in meeting customer requirements and project objectives. As an example in the geospatial field, the OGC Interoperability Program organizes and manages Interoperability Initiatives based on a rapid engineering process to develop, test, demonstrate, and promote the use of OGC standards. Such initiatives typically provide the initial working prototypes that are positioned to be the next best standards. Complemented by a solid architecture framework, this process allows for the development of set of standards for adoption in mature products. This panel hosts representatives from standards-development organizations and industry to provide their perspectives on the agile processes in geoinformatics standards development and their value to their members/customers in the era of ubiquitous geospatial informatics. Such agile processes contribute to achieving the guiding vision of a world in which everyone benefits from geographic information and services made available across any network, application, or platform.},

abstract={Waterfall and Extreme Programming are two software project methods used for project management. Although there are a number of opinions comparing the two methods regarding how they should be applied, none have used project data to clearly conclude which one is better. In this paper, we present the results of a controlled empirical study conducted at Carnegie Mellon University in Silicon Valley to learn about the effective transition from traditional development to agile development. We conducted a comparison research against these two approaches. Multiple teams were assigned a project; some used Waterfall development, others used Extreme Programming. The purpose of this research is to look at advantages and disadvantages based upon the outcomes, generated artifacts, and metrics produced by the teams. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Computer Science capstone programs in many universities provide students with the opportunity to develop software systems/tools for industrial companies. These projects are often completed using processes that can be considered "heavy weight" in order to provide students the experience of using the same tools and practices found in industry. For example, North Dakota State University uses a set of processes modeled after CMMI level 2. However, over the past several years, many sponsoring companies have transitioned towards agile software development processes. In order to better prepare students for this, it is necessary to provide capstone projects offering an agile option as well as the more traditional methods. Interviews were conducted with developers and managers from five sponsoring companies using agile processes. The results of these interviews and feedback from student teams that have used agile are being used to create an agile software development process designed for capstone projects. This paper describes the agile methodology, a summary of suggestions from interviews and student feedback, and plans for incorporating agile processes in the capstone course. © 2011 IEEE.},

This paper outlines a course in IS Project Management that is well-suited for an audience consisting of students from the information systems, business and computer science streams, who normally make up a graduate class. The course begins by adopting a process-neutral perspective towards activities such as requirements and estimation, before proceeding to discuss Agile methods. A team project allows participants to develop a hands-on feel for ASD, with the help of an Agile PM platform. The author has recently taught the course as proposed at his institution.

abstract={The nature of scientific research and the development of scientific software have similarities with processes that follow the agile manifesto: responsiveness to change and collaboration are of the utmost importance. But how well do current scientific software development processes match the practices found in agile development methods, and what are the effects of using agile practices in such processes? In order to investigate this, we conduct a literature review, focusing on evaluating the agility present in a selection of scientific software projects. Both projects with intentionally agile practices and projects with a certain degree of agile elements are taken into consideration. In the agility assessment, we define and utilize an agile mapping chart. The elements of the mapping chart are based on Scrum and XP, thus covering two of the most prominent agile reference models. We compared the findings of the literature review to results of a previously conducted survey. The comparison indicates that scientific software development projects adopting agile practices perceive their testing to be better than average. No difference to average projects was perceived regarding requirements-related activities. Future work includes an in-depth case study to further investigate the existence and impact of agility in three large scientific software projects, ultimately aiming at a better understanding of the particularities involved in developing scientific software.

abstract={Agile and user centered design integration (AUCDI) is of significant interest to researchers who want to achieve synergy and eliminate limitations of each. Currently, there are no clear principles or guidelines for practitioners to achieve successful integration. In addition, substantial differences exist between agile and UCD approaches which pose challenges to integration attempts. As a result, practitioners developed individual integration strategies. However, success evaluation of current AUCDI attempts has been anecdotal. Moreover, AUCDI attempts cannot be generalized to provide guidance and assistance to other projects or organizations with different needs. My thesis aims to provide a Software Process Improvement (SPI) framework for AUCDI by providing generic guidelines and practices for organizations aspiring to achieve AUCDI in order to address AUCDI challenges including: introducing systematicity and structure into AUCDI, assessing AUCDI processes, and accommodating project and organizational characteristics. © 2011 Author.},

abstract={Dynamic languages are becoming increasingly popular for different software development scenarios such as rapid prototyping because of the flexibility and agile interactive development they offer. The benefits of dynamic languages are, however, counteracted by many limitations produced by the lack of static typing. In order to obtain the benefits of both approaches, some programming languages offer a hybrid dynamic and static type system. The existing IDEs for these hybrid typing languages do not provide any type-based feature when dynamic typing is used, lacking important IDE facilities offered for statically typed code. We have implemented a constraint-based type inference system that gathers type information of dynamic references at compile time. Using this type information, we have extended a professional IDE to offer those type-based features missed for dynamically typed code. Following the Separation of Concerns principle, the IDE has also been customized to facilitate the conversion of dynamically typed code into statically typed one, and vice versa.

A specific refactoring is identified by a name (e.g., Extract Method), a set of preconditions, and a set of transformations that need to be performed. Tool support for refactoring is essential because checking the preconditions of refactoring often requires nontrivial program analysis, and applying transformations may affect many locations throughout a program. In recent years, the emergence of light-weight programming methodologies such as Extreme Programming has generated a great amount of interest in refactoring, and refactoring support has become a required feature in today's IDEs. This workshop is a continuation of a series of previous workshops (ECOOP 2007, OOPSLA 2008 and 2009 - see http://refactoring.info/WRT) where researchers and developers of refactoring tools can meet and discuss recent ideas and work, and view tool demonstrations. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={Background: Software product lines and Agile methods have been an effective solution for dealing with the growing complexity of software and handling competitive needs of software organizations. They also share common goals, such as improving productivity, reducing time-to-market, decreasing development costs and increasing customer satisfaction. There has been growing interest in whether the integration of Agile and SPL could provide further benefits and solve many of the outstanding issues surrounding software development. Objective: This study investigates the state-of-the-art in Agile SPL approaches, while identifying gaps in current research and synthesizing available evidence. It also provides a basis for a deeper understanding of the issues involved in the integration of Agile and SPL. Method: A mapping study was undertaken to analyze the relation between Agile and SPL methods. A set of four research questions were defined in which the 32 primary studies were evaluated. Results: This study provides insights into the integration of Agile and SPL approaches, it identifies the current gaps in the research, synthesize the available evidence and propose specific Agile methods and practices for integration in SPL. Conclusions: In general, few studies describe the underlying Agile principles being adopted by proposed Agile SPL solutions. The most common Agile practices proposed by the studies came from the XP and Scrum methods, particularly in the pro-active SPL strategy. We identify certain Agile methods that are being overlooked by the Agile SPL community, and propose specific SPL practices areas suitable for adoption of Agile practices.

abstract={Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) demands upfront long-term investment in (i) designing a common set of core-assets and (ii) managing variability across the products from the same family. When anticipated changes in these core-assets have been predicted with certain accuracy, SPLE has proved significant improvements. However, when large/complex software product line projects have to deal with changing market conditions, alternatives to supplement SPLE are required. Agile Software Development (ASD) may be an alternative, as agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage. However, when the aim is to scale Agile projects up to effectively manage reusability and variability across the products from the same family, alternatives to supplement agility are also required. As a result, a new approach called Agile Product Line Engineering (APLE) advocates integrating SPLE and ASD with the aim of addressing these gaps. APLE is an emerging approach, which implies that organizations have to face several barriers to achieve its adoption. This paper presents a systematic literature review of experiences and practices on APLE, in which the key findings uncover important challenges about how to integrate the SPLE model with an agile iterative approach to fully put APLE into practice.

abstract={DNA sequence variation is the underlying basis of common human traits and rarer single-gene disorders. Understanding the variome, the variants in an individual's genome, is essential to enable the ultimate goals of personalized medicine. This critical research field has grown dramatically in recent years, mostly due to the spread and development of genotyping technologies. Despite these activities being promoted by the Human Genome Variation Society and projects such as the Human Variome Project or the European GEN2PHEN Project, variome data-integration systems are far from being widely used in the research community workflow. Most of ongoing research is focused on improving locus-specific databases. Although the quality and manual curation of LSDBs adds true value to this domain, they are often narrow, heterogeneous, and independent systems. This hampers data harmonization and interoperability between systems, stifling the aggregation of data from LSDBs and related data sources.

abstract={In 2000, the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) initiated its Trilogy program in order to upgrade FBI infrastructure technologies, address national security concerns, and provide agents and analysts greater investigative abilities through creation of an FBI-wide network and improved user applications. Lacking an appropriate enterprise architecture foundation, IT expertise, and management skills, the FBI cancelled further development of Trilogy Phase 3, Virtual Case File (VCF), with prime contractor SAIC after numerous delays and increasing costs. The FBI began development of Sentinel in 2006 through Lockheed Martin. Unlike in the case of Trilogy, the FBI decided to implement a service-oriented architecture (SOA) provided in part by commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components, clarify contracts and requirements, increase its use of metrics and oversight through the life of the project, and employ IT personnel differently in order to meet Sentinel objectives. Although Lockheed Martin was eventually released from their role in the project due to inadequate performance, the project is still moving forward on account of the use of best practices. The case highlights key events in both VCF and Sentinel development and demonstrates the FBI's IT transformation over the past four years. Copyright © 2011, IGI Global.},

abstract={Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is considered to be an important enabler of Internet of Services. By adopting SOA in development, business services can be offered, mediated, and traded as web services, so as to support agile and dynamic business collaborations on the Internet. Business collaboration is often implemented as cross-enterprise processes and involves more than one business entity which agrees to join the collaboration. To enable trustworthy and secure provision of services and service composition across enterprise boundaries, trust between business participants must be established, that is, user identities and access rights must be federated, to support business functions defined in the business processes. This paper proposes an approach which derives trust federation from formally described business process models, such as BPMN and WS-CDL processes, to automate security configuration of business collaborations. The result of the derivation is trust policies which identify trust relationships between business participants and can be enforced in enterprises' service runtimes with support of a policy deployment infrastructure. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={There are many evidences in the literature that the use self-managing teams has positive impacts on several dimensions of team effectiveness. Agile methods, supported by the Agile Manifesto, defend the use of self-managing teams in software development in substitution of hierarchically managed, traditional teams. The goal of this research was to study how a self-managing software team works in practice and how the behaviors of the software organization support or hinder the effectiveness of such teams. We performed a single case holistic case study, looking in depth into the actual behavior of a mature Scrum team in industry. Using interviews and participant observation, we collected qualitative data from five team members in several interactions. We extract the behavior of the team and of the software company in terms of the determinants of self-managing team effectiveness defined in a theoretical model from the literature. We found evidence that 17 out of 24 determinants of this model exist in the studied context. We concluded that certain determinants can support or facilitate the adoption of methodologies like Scrum, while the use of Scrum may affect other determinants. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={Cognitive radios are becoming the technological foundation for efficiently managing the scarcity of wireless spectrum, fulfilling various QoS demands and allowing different networks to coexist. Cognition and spectrum agility in MAC protocols require adaptability and close PHY-MAC interaction. Classically, MAC protocols have been implemented in hardware, which gives a limited possibility for reconfiguration and customization. Recently, software based MAC implementations have emerged although a close hardware-software co-design is typically required to keep the time critical operations in ASICs or FPGAs. We introduce a MAC development framework for enabling fast composition of MAC protocols, which are best fitted to the application requirements, communication capabilities of the radio, and current spectrum regulations and policies. We decompose MAC protocols into their basic functionalities which are perceived as building blocks and are partitioned across hardware/software. Our framework allows on-the-fly realization of the envisioned MAC protocol through wiring of these fundamental components. By exposing extended metadata and hardware functionalities for the MAC implementation through our granular components, together with the support for run-time re-configuration, spectrum agile and cognitive MAC solutions can be easily realized. In this paper, we describe the design rationale and implementation details of our framework on WARP [1] boards. We show through experimental evaluation that the framework provides flexible means for prototyping different reconfigurable cognitive and spectrum agile MAC protocols. © 2011 IEEE.},

For a wireless ad hoc network with constraint computational resources, the cryptosystem based on symmetric key algorithms is extremely suitable for such an agile and dynamic environment, along with other security strategies. In this paper, we introduce the concept of selective encryption into the design of data protection mechanisms. First, we present the principle of selective encryption and propose a probabilistically selective encryption algorithm based on symmetric key. By utilizing probabilistic methodology and stochastic algorithm, a sender includes proper uncertainty in the process of message encryption, so that only entrusted receiver can decrypt the ciphertext and other unauthorized nodes have no knowledge of the transmitted messages on the whole. In addition, we also employ other security mechanisms to enhance the security of our proposed scheme. Eventually, we carry out an extensive set of simulation experiments based on ns2 simulator, and our simulation indicates that the technique of selective algorithms can indeed improve the efficiency of message encryption. © 2011 IEEE.},

However, recent results suggest that this practice is not followed to the extent preferred by industry. In order to pinpoint specific obstacles limiting its industrial adoption we have conducted a systematic literature review on empirical studies explicitly focusing on TDD as well as indirectly addressing TDD. Our review has identified seven limiting factors viz., increased development time, insufficient TDD experience/knowledge, lack of upfront design, domain and tool specific issues, lack of developer skill in writing test cases, insufficient adherence to TDD protocol, and legacy code. The results of this study is of special importance to the testing community, since it outlines the direction for further detailed scientific investigations as well as highlights the requirement of guidelines to overcome these limiting factors for successful industrial adoption of TDD. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={In 2005, the European Space Agency carried out a study intended to clarify the use of PDAs for onboard space operations. Being this a rather new application domain due to the introduction of uncommon technology onboard, a need for feasibility clarification was perceived. The study narrowed its unbounded technological dimension by focusing on Java technologies. Furthermore, at a software engineering level an "agile" approach was chosen for evaluation because of the high degree of user interaction and their ability to cope with general requirement changes like those resulting from the uncertainty about the actual features and quality of specific PDA platforms and COTS. Two studies were performed in parallel with the same objectives but obtaining different solutions. Suitable "agile-like" approaches compatible with space software standards were defined and tried. A space crew representative was involved from the early phases of the studies, and a final evaluation exercise at the European Astronaut Centre training facilities was performed. Feedback on the suitability of the technologies and the MMI design choices were obtained together with other unexpected lessons. The paper is concluded with an enumeration of lessons learnt and hypotheses about "agile" approaches of interest for the software engineering community. © 2010 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

abstract={Nowadays, Scrum is the most used Agile Methodology, while the Lean-Kanban approach is perhaps the fastest growing AM. On the other hand, traditional, waterfall-like approaches are still very used in real-life software projects, due to the ease of up-front planning and budgeting, that however are seldom matched upon project completion. In our opinion, more effort is needed to study and model the inner structure and behavior of these approaches, highlighting positive and negative feedback loops that are strategic to understand their features, and to decide on their adoption. In this paper we analyze the dynamic behavior of the adoption of Kanban and Scrum, versus a traditional software development process such as the Waterfall approach. We use a system dynamics model, based on the relationships between system variables, to assess the relative benefits of the studied approaches. The model is simulated using a commercial tool. The proposed model visualizes the relationships among these software development processes, and can be used to study their relative advantages and disadvantages. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Agile Methods are a set of software practices that can help to produce products faster and at the same time deliver what customers want. Despite the benefits that Agile methods can deliver, however, we found few studies from the Southeast Asia region, particularly Malaysia. As a result, less empirical evidence can be obtained in the country making its implementation harder. To use a new method, experience from other practitioners is critical, which describes what is important, what is possible and what is not possible concerning Agile. We conducted a qualitative study to understand the issues faced by early adopters in Malaysia where Agile methods are still relatively new. The initial study involves 13 participants including project managers, CEOs, founders and software developers from seven organisations. Our study has shown that social and human aspects are important when using Agile methods. While technical aspects have always been considered to exist in software development, we found these factors to be less important when using Agile methods. The results obtained can serve as guidelines to practitioners in the country and the neighbouring regions. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

However, despite work has been done, there is still a lack of substantial evidence of pair programming effects in industrial environments. To increase a body of evidence regarding the real benefits of pair programming, we investigate its relationship with software defects. The analysis is based on 14-months data collected from a large Italian manufacturing company. The team of 17 developers adopted a customized version of extreme programming and used pair programming on a daily basis. We explore and compare the defect rate of the code changed by doing pair and solo programming. The results show that defects appear to be lower for the code modified during pair programming. As a consequence, we formulate a hypothesis that pair programming is effective in reducing the introduction of new defects when existing code is modified. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The data on project management activities were collected in order to measure the amount of work completed, compliance with the release and iteration plans, and ability of effort estimation, thus contributing to evidence-based assessment of the typical Scrum processes. It was found that the initial plans and effort estimates were over-optimistic, but the abilities of estimating and planning improved from Sprint to Sprint. Most teams were able to define almost accurate Sprint plans after three Sprints. In the third Sprint the velocity stabilized and the actual achievement almost completely matched the plan.},

abstract={Developing Web-based systems for agriculture and rural development requires the collaboration of experts from different scientific fields and backgrounds. Thus, it is crucial to ensure that the involved specialists have a common language that everybody understands. On the other hand, although the information and communication technologies (ICT) and particularly the Internet are drivers for overcoming the disadvantages of rural areas with respect to markets and suppliers, rural businesses are characterized by low ICT adoption and limited use of e-government services. In this light, this paper focuses on the analysis, design and deployment of an e-government observatory for rural small and medium enterprises (SMEs) according to the unified modeling language (UML)-based rational unified process (RUP) life cycle approach. The proposed observatory allows rural SMEs to find information both on e-government services offered in their region, as well as to have access to e-learning content on how they can use such services. The successful implementation and evaluation of the observatory, provides also useful contributions about modeling, analyzing, designing and documenting such systems using UML with rational unified process. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The CyberKnife system deploys a linac mounted on an agile robot and directed under image guidance for stereotactic radiotherapy using nonisocentric beam delivery. A design advantage of the CyberKnife system is its method of active image guidance during treatment delivery. Recent developments in the hardware and software of the system have significantly enhanced its functionality: (a) an optimized path traversal process significantly reduces the robot motion time, resulting in reductions of overall treatment times of at least 5-10 min; (b) to optimize the accuracy of dose calculation in CyberKnife planning/delivery, Monte Carlo algorithms have been introduced; (c) the new IRIS collimator reduces the monitor units required, increases treatment speed and improves conformality and homogeneity of treatment plans; (d) XSight lung tracking, an algorithm for fiducial-less lung tracking, has been developed for peripheral, radio-dense lung tumors with diameters >15 mm; and (e) a sequential optimization planning process incorporates a more flexible approach to optimize the multiple, complex treatment planning criteria used today. The clinical efficacy of CyberKnife radiosurgery for brain/head lesions such as metastases, arteriovenous malformations, acoustic neuromas and meningiomas is well established. Since there is no need for skeletal fixation with the CyberKnife, radiosurgery can be applied to targets beyond the brain, and the technology has been extensively used for stereotactic body radiotherapy, treating targets in many anatomic sites. Currently, clinical studies have been completed or are ongoing for common malignancies including tumors involving the spine, lung, pancreas, liver and prostate. Copyright © 2011 S.

abstract={Hosted software-as-a-service products provide an opportunity to provide consumers with continuous deployment of new features, as opposed to scheduled version upgrades as is the norm for products installed on-premise. In order to exploit this opportunity, a SaaS provider needs to adopt an agile process that is capable of releasing new features rapidly. The SCRUM [5,6] process is ideally suited for this purpose: However, when SCRUM has been used for agile development of an installed product, parallel, overlapping 'sprints' are executed by separate teams, each dealing with short, medium, and longer-term enhancements to the product[3]; with the result that version upgrades are therefore easier to manage. In contrast, in the case of a SAAS product, version upgrades are no longer a constraint, so we can do better. In this paper we describe 'Continuous SCRUM', a variant of Type-C SCRUM, augmented with engineering best practices, in a manner ideally suited for managing SAAS products. In our approach, bug-fixes, minor enhancements, as well as major features are released continuously, on a weekly basis by a single team, in contrast to "Meta-SCRUM" [3]. We also present field data from our experience with using Continuous SCRUM for a hosted platform-as-a-service product for more than two years. Our experience reinforces other recent evidence [11] that rapid, smaller releases are often preferable to infrequent, larger ones. Continuous SCRUM provides a mechanism to achieve and sustain a rapid release cycle, for SAAS products as well as, we believe, for custom applications developed in-house.},

abstract={Organizations delivering offshore software development services have traditionally focused on CMMI framework to deliver quality software. With agile methodologies gaining more wide spread acceptance, such organizations cannot stay away from them. There are concerns about combining agile methodologies with offshoring. There are also concerns about mismatch of agile methodologies with CMMI framework. In this paper we have looked at the problem from the perspective of an offshore software development organization and recounted our experience in adopting agile methodology in executing fixed price agile project. The challenges we have faced comes from three different dimensions. First is to address the issue of having an agile team split across two different countries. The second is to execute the agile project within the framework prescribed under CMMI. Here the challenge is not only to address the actual gap between CMMI and agile methodologies but also to address the perceived shortcomings of agile methodologies. The third dimension is to execute the project as a fixed price one where the requirement is not frozen at the beginning of the project. We have listed the challenges that we have faced. They can be categorized under requirements management, contract management, team management, distributed working, when to design, role of a specialist, testing challenges and CMMI adherence. The different solutions tried and the levels of success in overcoming them have also been included. Our experience indicates that agile methodologies can coexist with offshoring and CMMI framework.},

abstract={Modern information systems, which are the result of the interconnection of systems of many organizations, run in variable contexts, and require both a lightweight approach to interoperability and the capability to actively react to changing requirements and failures. Model-Driven Development (MDD) and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) are software development approaches that deal with this complexity, reducing time and cost development and augmenting flexibility and interoperability. Although, requirements engineering is accepted as a critical activity in these approaches, there is a need to appropriately integrate and automate the requirements modeling and transformation tasks as part of MDD and SOA development approaches. Our proposal is a Rational Unified Process (RUP) extension, in which the requirements discipline is placed in a model-driven context in order to derive SOAs.

abstract={The microcirculation plays a critical role is maintaining organ health and function by serving as a vascular are where trophic metabolism exchanges between blood and tissue takes place. To facilitate regular assessment in vivo, non-invasive microcirculation imagers are required in clinics. Among this group of clinical devices, are those that render microcirculation morphology such as nailfold capillaroscopy, a common device for early diagnosis and monitoring of microangiopathies. However, depth ambiguity disqualify this and other similar techniques in medical tomography where due to the 3-D nature of biological organs, imagers that support depth-resolved 2-D imaging and 3-D image reconstruction are required. Here, we introduce correlation map OCT (cmOCT), a promising technique for microcirculation morphology imaging that combines standard optical coherence tomography and an agile imaging analysis software based on correlation statistic. Promising results are presented of the microcirculation morphology images of the brain region of a small animal model as well as measurements of vessel geometry at bifurcations, such as vessel diameters, branch angles. These data will be useful for obtaining cardiovascular related characteristics such as volumetric flow, velocity profile and vessel-wall shear stress for circulatory and respiratory system.},

abstract={The technological environment in which software engineering education (SEE) resides and thrives continues to evolve. In this paper, SW4CSE2, a methodology for collaborations in SEE based on the Social Web environment, is proposed. The impact of integrating Social Web technologies, and applications based on these technologies, in collaborative activities that commonly occur in the context of SEE are explored. In particular, teacher-student and student-student collaborations, both inside and outside the classroom, are highlighted. In doing so, the feasibility issues in selection and adoption of technologies/ applications are emphasized, and the use of pedagogically-inclined patterns is made. The potential prospects of such an integration, and related concerns, are illustrated by practical examples. Copyright © 2011, IGI Global.},

abstract={Agile software development processes are widely adopted in software engineering projects. Their low organizational overhead and iterative nature make them ideal choices for small development teams. The application of those methods in software projects that require collaboration between multiple sub-teams is a challenging task that remains subject to intensive research. Especially the initial phases of such projects are crucial for project success since a problem-free inception period generates a basis for efficient development later in the process. We introduce a testbed that allows analyzing collaboration processes during those early stages of software development within a low-risk, educational setup. Participants of a software engineering lecture form development teams of considerable size and develop real-life applications in a realistic, yet controlled, environment. By combining manual observations with the computational analysis of digital collaboration artifacts we are able to gain insights into distinctive patterns of collaboration activity and reason about their triggers within the process setup. © 2011 IEEE.},

Sulake introduced Scrum in 2006 and within 6 months institutionalized Scrum across the organization. The company was surveyed in 2009 and responses from 19 managers and 36 non-managers were carefully studied. The biggest challenges of Scrum for managers were keeping up with the team and learning to "let go" and stop micro-managing the teams. Managers report Scrum increases productivity (73%), increases quality (58%), and makes it easier to change direction (84%). The role of the manager changes from telling people what to do into communicating goals and visions (a key insight of Takeuchi and Nonaka [1]).

abstract={A framework for lowering the borders of service delivery and service composition in telecommunication networks is proposed in this work. In our opinion such an agile framework is needed for two main reasons. At first the cycle of introducing new services in the telecommunication industry usually takes several months, while the general cycles in the Web domain are much faster. Besides, customers want to use a flexible amount of services from different kinds of sources (e.g. Google, Facebook). The proposed agile service environment is intended to interact with services of the traditional telecommunication industry and is enabling the third party development process to support services coming from all kind of domains. Service platforms for Next Generation Networks adapting the principles of Service Oriented Architectures and the initial steps in the standardization towards service delivery frameworks are done. Special requirements that have to be considered are aspects of service life-cycle management and service composition that are critical regarding high performing real-time communication processes as needed in a telecommunications environment. Beyond the requirements of dynamic service deployment, management, evolution and service termination there is the intention of a well performing agile service composition mechanism. In order to fulfill the discussed requirements some related work in this area is presented and the promising IT / Network standards are enlightened. Furthermore, the architectural design of the developed framework is presented. Finally the paper demonstrates a practical use case scenario that shows the dynamic integration and combination of telecommunication services with services of the Web domain.},

Agile engineering provides a list of tips for other engineers on how to accommodate changes that include adopting a more iterative style, deferring decisions in uncertain areas, and creating and maintaining options. Some tips that can make projects more change-friendly include moving beyond the fixed schedules, keeping in touch with customers, and development teams making more decisions.},

abstract={Context: Many organizations have started to deploy agile methods, but so far there exist only a few studies on organization-wide transformations. Are agile methods here to stay? Some claim that agile software development methods are in the mainstream adoption phase in the software industry, while others hope that those are a passing fad. The assumption here is that if agile would not provide real improvement, adopters would be eager at first but turn pessimistic after putting it into practice. Objective: Despite the growing amount of anecdotal evidence on the success of agile methods across a wide range of different real-life development settings, scientific studies remain scarce. Even less is known about the perception of the impacts of agile transformation when it is deployed in a very large software development environment, and whether agile methods are here to stay. This study aims to fill that gap by providing evidence from a large-scale agile transformation within Nokia. While we have yet to confirm these findings with solid quantitative data, we believe that the perception of the impacts already pinpoints the direction of the impacts of large-scale agile transformation. Method: The data were collected using a questionnaire. The population of the study contains more than 1000 respondents in seven different countries in Europe, North America, and Asia. Results: The results reveal that most respondents agree on all accounts with the generally claimed benefits of agile methods. These benefits include higher satisfaction, a feeling of effectiveness, increased quality and transparency, increased autonomy and happiness, and earlier detection of defects. Finally, 60% of respondents would not like to return to the old way of working. Conclusion: While the perception of the impact of agile methods is predominantly positive, several challenge areas were discovered. However, based on this study, agile methods are here to stay. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In spite of their industrial success, the development of intelligent systems is still a complex and risky task. When building intelligent systems, we see that domain knowledge is often present at different levels of formalization-ranging from text documents to explicit rules. In this paper, we describe the knowledge formalization continuum as a metaphor to help domain specialists during the knowledge acquisition phase. To make use of the knowledge formalization continuum, the agile use of knowledge representations within a knowledge engineering project is proposed, as well as transitions between the different representations, when required. We show that a semantic wiki is a flexible tool for engineering knowledge on the knowledge formalization continuum. Case studies are taken from one industrial and one academic project, and they illustrate the applicability and benefits of semantic wikis in combination with the knowledge formalization continuum.},

In the third part, a new theory for a 2nd-order frequency-agile filter is introduced. The center frequency of the filter is proportional to the gain of a feedback amplifier and thus can be tuned over a wide frequency range. This new theory is thereafter generalized to the nth-class leading to a center frequency proportional to (A)n/2 . Simulation results of band pass agile filters in current mode and made from second-generation current controlled conveyors (CCCII+) in 0.25 μ m SiGe BiCMOS technology are given for n =1 and n =2. These simulation results along with results of measurements carried out on the fabricated filters entirely confirm the new approach.

abstract={Today's competitive market demands immediate attention on security issues for developing secure software system. Security must be an integral part of any application development methodology. It becomes more challenging when developers design projects according to agile methodology. Traditional ways of development are sequential considering major changes during analysis. Agile methodology is required as there is a need for an iterative approach which encourages changes in requirements at any stage in software development lifecycle. In this paper, we are presenting a framework which effectively implements security practices in agile development and adopts additional features proposed by other researchers. The key point in our framework is that we are embedding a hybrid technique for requirement elicitation with Agile Software Development (ASD). This technique would combine abuser stories and attack trees drawing best features of each of their individual methods. This hybrid technique maps security threats found during security requirements effectively as compared to individual techniques. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

In this paper, we propose a novel agent-based architecture for an e-procurement system in which agent technology is applied to deal with the internal and external uncertainties. Through the collaboration and interaction between different agents, the architecture that we propose can enhance the flexibility to handle unexpected exceptions, thus leading to agile procurement management. To valid the feasibility of our approach, a case study has been conducted to investigate how our agents collaborate to manage the inventory failure exception which occurs in restaurant e-procurement. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Traceability is recognized to be important for supporting agile development processes. However, after analyzing many of the existing traceability approaches it can be concluded that they strongly depend on traditional development process characteristics. Within this paper it is justified that this is a drawback to support adequately agile processes. As it is discussed, some concepts do not have the same semantics for traditional and agile methodologies. This paper proposes three features that traceability models should support to be less dependent on a specific development process: (1) user-definable traceability links, (2) roles, and (3) linkage rules. To present how these features can be applied, an emerging traceability metamodel (TmM) will be used within this paper. Tm Msupports the definition of traceability methodologies adapted to the needs of each project. As it is shown, after introducing these three features into traceability models, two main advantages are obtained: 1) the support they can provide to agile process stakeholders is significantly more extensive, and 2) it will be possible to achieve a higher degree of automation. In this sense it will be feasible to have a methodical trace acquisition and maintenance process adapted to agile processes. © The Author(s) 2011.},

Recent policy reforms by the FCC are paving the way by freeing up spectrum for a new generation of frequency-agile wireless devices based on software defined radios (SDRs). But despite recent advances in SDR hardware, research on SDR MAC protocols or applications requires an experimental platform for managing physical access. We introduce Papyrus, a software platform for wireless researchers to develop and experiment dynamic spectrum systems using currently available SDR hardware. Papyrus provides two fundamental building blocks at the physical layer: flexible non-contiguous frequency access and simple and robust frequency detection. Papyrus allows researchers to deploy and experiment new MAC protocols and applications on USRP GNU Radio, and can also be ported to other SDR platforms. We demonstrate the use of Papyrus using Jello, a distributedMAC overlay for high-bandwidth media streaming applications and Ganache, a SDR layer for adaptable guardband configuration. Full implementations of Papyrus and Jello are publicly available.},

This paper also explains the integration bottleneck and difficulty of enterprise internal heterogeneous system and supplier's heterogeneous data, in addition to solve problem and increase system agility to enable developers easily maintain system. We expect adopting SOA can increase enterprise and its supplier's operating incoming and cost down.},

abstract={Carefully implemented technology strategies are vital to the success of large-scale initiatives such as the U.S. Army's Comprehensive Soldier Fitness (CSF) program. Achieving the U.S. Army's vision for CSF required a robust information technology platform that was scaled to millions of users and that leveraged the Internet to enable global reach. The platform needed to be agile, provide powerful real-time reporting, and have the capacity to quickly transform to meet emerging requirements. Existing organizational applications, such as " Single Sign-On," and authoritative data sources were exploited to the maximum extent possible. Development of the " Soldier Fitness Tracker" is the most recent, and possibly the best, demonstration of the potential benefits possible when existing organizational capabilities are married to new, innovative applications. Combining the capabilities of the extant applications with the newly developed applications expedited development, eliminated redundant data collection, resulted in the exceeding of program objectives, and produced a comfortable experience for the end user, all in less than six months. This is a model for future technology integration. © 2011 American Psychological Association.},

Scrum is a project management approach and is most commonly adopted in the global industry today and Pakistan's software industry is also adopting Scrum for acquiring utmost benefit from this methodology. The primary rationale of this paper is to get an insight into Scrum adoption, implementation and acceptance in Pakistan's software industry. Another purpose is also to understand how much Scrum is feasible; particularly for Pakistan's software industry.

abstract={Computer software is an engine of growth of social-economy development which requires new engineering techniques and strategies. The demand for quality in software applications has grown. Hence as software becomes more integrated into our lives, the effects of software failures become more acute. Testing is an essential part of software development providing an indicator of the quality of the software. Testing remains the primary way to improve reliability of software. Billions of dollars are spent on testing in the software industry, as testing usually accounts for more than half the cost of software development. The demand of new engineering technologies for quality in software applications has grown and awareness of software testing-related issues plays an important role of all testing levels. The unit level of testing has undergone the most recent and most dramatic change. With the introduction of new agile (aka, "lightweight") development methods, such as XP (eXtreme Programming) came the idea of Test-Driven Development (TDD). The TDD is a software development engineering technique that melds program design, implementation and testing in a series micro-iterations that focus on simplicity and feedback. Programmer tests are created using a unit testing framework and are 100% automated. This paper contributes in the development of TDD framework for testing of unit, which includes new engineering concepts and the methodologies issues in form of TDD techniques using V design model especially for engineering education, industrial training and software development. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Many organizations have started to use agile development processes to speed up the development cycle and to improve the ability of the company in reacting to changing requirements. Adopting agile practices may happen as a revolution where all old practices are removed or as a more gradual process. In this paper, we discuss lessons learnt in two agile transition processes. Based on our experience, agile processes can be used in embedded software development for products. The challenges include the varying size of user requirements, the role of system requirements, and architecturally significant requirements. It is difficult for large organizations to be agile. Work allocation for a large number of different teams with different competencies tends to decrease speed, and increase the role of design and management. We conclude that agile development in this context needs very skilled developers and has to be a combination of new and old practices. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={This article discusses the question if Scrum and XP is well suited for development of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) software. The reason for choosing Scrum and XP is based on two facts. Firstly, CSE developers are not used to formal processes for software development and Scrum and XP are informal in nature, hence easier to adopt. Secondly CSE projects are often once-off and aimed at producing scientific results rather than commercial software, so the overhead of a process or methodology needs to be kept at a minimum. Scrum and XP are focused on producing software, thus keeping everything else, i.e. the overhead to a minimum, a fact that benefits CSE development. In this article, the characteristics of Scrum and XP in particular and agile development in general are evaluated against the needs of CSE developers. The results show that almost all the key points in both methodologies are well suited for CSE development and that agile development in general is a good match with CSE.},

abstract={Nowadays, various user-centered and participatory design methodologies with different degree of agility are followed when building sophisticated socio-technical systems. Even when applying these methods, non-functional requirements (NFRs) are often considered too late in the development process and tension that may arise between users' and developers' needs remains mostly neglected. Furthermore, there is a conceptual lack of guidance and support for efficiently fulfilling NFRs in terms of software architecture in general. This paper aims at introducing the AFFINE framework simultaneously addressing these needs with (1) conceptually considering NFRs early in the development process, (2) explicitly balancing end-users' with developers' needs, and (3) a reference architecture providing support for NFRs. Constitutive requirements for AFFINE were gathered based on experiences from various projects on designing and implementing groupware systems. © 2010 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={From 2005 to 2008, we explored different models of collaboration in student software development projects. In the past, project roles were distributed across students in the US, Cambodia, India and Thailand. What was common to our previous models was the co-location of developers, the client and quality assurance roles being the ones that were commonly distributed. A loose waterfall software development process was always used and activities were supported by a mashup of technologies. In 2009, we distributed the developers across the US, India and Senegal to form a truly distributed developer role. We also switched to the use of Agile methodologies with Scrum and to an end-to-end tooling solution, specifically the IBM Rational Team Concert environment. This paper describes the new model and reports on the evolution of our process and tooling infrastructure. In particular, it investigates how well Agile and Scrum practices supported our model and how important tooling is to their implementation.

abstract={Agile has been used to refer to a software development paradigm that emphasizes rapid and flexible development. In the meanwhile, we have through our practical experiences in scaling up agile methods, noticed that architecture plays an important role. Due to the interrelationship between agile methods and architecture, as well as divergent perceptions on their correlation stated in numerous sources, we are motivated to find out how these perceptions are supported by findings in the research community in general and in empirical studies in particular. To fully benefit from agile practices and architectural disciplines, we need empirical data on the perceived and experienced impacts of introducing agile methods to existing software development process, as well as correlations between agile and architecture. In this paper, we survey the research literature for statements made regarding the relationship between agile development and software architecture. The main findings are that there is a lack of scientific support for many of the claims that are concerned with agile and architecture, and more empirical studies are needed to fully reveal the benefits and drawbacks implied by an agile software development method. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={The current trends in most software development organizations are in striving for high performance while meeting the emergent and even rapidly changing customer needs. Traditional product development models are often ineffective in such respects. Now Lean and Agile software models address many of those particular concerns. However, empirical evidence of their actual performance effects is still scarce and probably many hidden inefficiencies exist in practical software projects. For example the Kanban process model is one of the latest proposals with apparent potential to improve the efficiency of the projects. This paper explores how software development activities and process improvement can be evaluated in such cases. A research model is constructed for the purpose of this investigation. New research hypotheses can be derived and tested empirically with case study projects. By applying the supported hypotheses in practice, the model is intended to be a systematic performance development vehicle for software projects and a provisional framework for the Lean software enterprise transformation research and development. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Cloud computing is all the rage these days; its confluence with mobile computing would bring an even more pervasive influence. Clouds per se are elastic computing infrastructure where mobile applications can offload or draw tasks in an on-demand push-pull manner. Lightweight and portable task migration support enabling better resource utilization and data access locality is the key for success of mobile cloud computing. Existing task migration mechanisms are however too coarse-grained and costly, offsetting the benefits from migration and hampering flexible task partitioning among the mobile and cloud resources. We propose a new computation migration technique called stack-on-demand (SOD) that exports partial execution states of a stack machine to achieve agile mobility, easing into small-capacity devices and flexible distributed execution in a multi-domain workflow style. Our design also couples SOD with a novel object faulting technique for efficient access to remote objects. We implement the SOD concept into a middleware system for transparent execution migration of Java programs. It is shown that SOD migration cost is pretty low, comparing to several existing migration mechanisms. We also conduct experiments with an iPhone handset to demonstrate the elasticity of SOD by which server-side heavyweight processes can run adaptively on the cell phone. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Software development is facing new challenges due to transformation from product based software engineering towards integration and collaboration based software engineering that embodies high degree of dynamism both at design time and run time. Short time-to-markets require cost reduction by maximizing software reuse; openness for new innovations presumes a flexible innovation platform and agile software development; and user satisfaction assumes high quality in a situation based manner. How to deal with these contradictory requirements in software engineering? The main contribution of this paper is a novel approach that is influenced by business innovation, human centered design, model driven development and ontology oriented design. The approach is called Ontology driven Piecemeal Software Engineering (OPSE). OPSE facilitates incremental software development based on software pieces that follow the design principles defined by means of ontologies. Its key elements are abstraction, aggregation and adaptivity. The approach is intended for and applied to the development of smart spaces. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={With the research and debates on software process, the mainstream software processes can be grouped into two categories, the plan-driven (disciplined) processes and the agile processes. In terms of the classification, personal software process (PSP) is a typical plan-driven process while SCRUM is an agile-style instance. Although they are distinct from each other per se, our research found that PSP and SCRUM may also complement each other when SCRUM provides an agile process management framework, and PSP provides the skills and disciplines that a qualified team member needs to estimate, plan and manage his/her job. This paper proposes an integrated process model, SCRUM-PSP, which combines the strengths of each. We also verified that this integrated process by adopting it into a real project environment where typical agile processes are favored, i.e. change-prone requirements, rapid development, fast delivery, etc. As a result, manageability and predictability which traditional plan-driven processes usually benefit can also be achieved. The work described in this paper is a worthy attempt to embrace both process agility and discipline. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper focuses on the management of the Agile projects running under Fixed Price Contracts. On May 2008 Exigen Services announced the launch of Innovative Fixed-Price Agile Package. Flex-agility is a packaged services offering which combines Agile methodologies with customer-aligned governance and fixed priced commercial terms. This package provides customers certainty in on-time and on-budget delivery, eliminating the difficulty of changing requirements while guaranteeing maximum value from their IT investments. The Flex-agility offering provides for changes to be introduced during any project without impacting the original schedule or budget. Use of Agile methods reduces the financial risks associated with large IT projects by treating the cause of the risk, not simply applying off-shore manpower. The paper examines the experience of running this model and describes the details, know-how and success factors that should be met to work under these types of contracts. At this moment several Fixed Price Agile contracts were completed and running and also this contractual model became standard approach for some of the large customers that have multiple projects running in XS.© 2010 IEEE.},

Increasingly game developers are providing their games online, employing web services; however, security threats evolve with the use of web services in such applications which is a great challenge for game developers. The roadblock to providing secure game applications is the lack of understanding of secure coding concepts by game programmers. In this paper we propose the 5W1H re-documentation technique and the use of the Scrum agile software development methodology in a reengineering process to educate game programmers concerning secure coding concepts. The authors first prove how insecure coding can affect the gaming industry by introducing an example of an insecure game login application. Then the same login application is re-documented and reengineered with secure coding concepts. The reengineered application is then tested for security threats.},

Outsourcing software design and development to firms in countries such as Vietnam is an important characteristic of global information technology. In response to these circumstances, an exploratory multi-site study into the adoption of agile methods was carried out in Vietnam using structured interviews. Outsourcing vendors reported additional challenges to incorporating agile methods into their software processes. The research offers additional data regarding the adoption of agile methods by industry, specifically regarding practices in Vietnam, and contributes to broadening the foundation for future research in global information systems. © 2010 IEEE.},

Agile methods promise code quality improvement, but while embracing the agile methods, software development organizations have realized that defects still do exist and must be managed. When the development is distributed over several sites, defect management can become even more challenging. In this study we analyzed defect data in a large multi-site organization during the first twelve months of their agile transformation. Complementing information was gathered by a survey, which was conducted in the organization twice: after six and after twelve months of starting the agile transformation. The results indicate that the defect reporting practices changed after the agile adoption was started, the defect inflow was more stable and the defect closing speed improved. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={In order to improve the information system development process many companies have adopted system development methodologies. Various evaluation methods and frameworks exist in the literature to assist companies during their adoption phase. However, a need was identified to evaluate the efficiency of a system development methodology after adoption. In an era where there is a reappraisal of the usefulness of system development methodologies it is essential to have a valid and reliable method of evaluation. The aim of this paper is to propose an evaluation model to measure post-implementation efficiency of a software development methodology. Data Envelopment Analysis, a linear programming method, is investigated as a means to evaluate efficiency of a SDM after adoption. This paper focus on the Scrum software development methodology as it is a popular methodology in use today. With Data Envelopment Analysis it is possible to classify different companies' use of Scrum as efficient or inefficient. The results also make it possible to identify specific areas in a company that needs improvement. These individual recommendations can be applied to increase the post-implementation efficiency of a company's systems development methodology.},

Heavyweight methodologies, also considered as the traditional way to develop software, emphasis on comprehensive planning, detailed documentation, and expansive design. Unlike traditional methods, agile methodologies employ short iterative cycles, and rely on tacit knowledge within a team. What is new about Agile methods is not the practices they use, but their recognition of people as the main driving force which can lead to project success,. Heavyweight methodologies, also considered as the traditional way to develop software, emphasis on comprehensive planning, detailed documentation, and expansive design. Unlike traditional methods, agile methodologies employ short iterative cycles, and rely on tacit knowledge within a team. This paper described the characteristics of some agile methodologies and tries to understand what is the driving force behind adoption of these methodologies?', what orgnisations have gained and lost after adopting these methodologies and what can be the future of these methodologies?},

abstract={Various agile software development methodologies, practices, and techniques have been proposed in the last decade; some present novel ideas, while many are simply made up of tasks and techniques borrowed from prominent agile methodologies. Each of these methodologies prescribes a set of practices and techniques which are deemed appropriate for application in a specific context. However, there exists no single method which fits all project situations. This has resulted in the advent of Situational Method Engineering (SME) approaches, which are used for developing software methodologies that are tailored to fit the specific circumstances of the project situation at hand. Since tool support has become an essential prerequisite for widespread adoption of software engineering methods, provision of Computer-Aided Method Engineering (CAME) tools has become a priority. We provide a basis for the application of assembly-based situational method engineering to the development of bespoke agile methodologies. To this aim, a comprehensive set of relevant methodology features has first been identified, spanning the range of possible requirements that a method engineer may define for the agile methodology under development. Based on this set of requirements, a method base has been proposed that contains the method chunks necessary for satisfying these requirements. The proposed method base conforms to the Software Process Engineering Metamodel (SPEM 2.0), and can be immediately plugged into CAME tools which implement this metamodel, including the Eclipse Process Framework Composer (EPFC). © 2010 IEEE.},

In R&D projects, an ergonomist often acts at the beginning of the project, during the design phase. Or he acts after the development phase by applying a user test to validate the service. The method that we have set up is a solution to integrate user-centered design and the agile developments to one another. It is based on short user tests which enable users to intervene during the development phase. The ergonomist realises user tests in cycles that match agile development ones. Results gained at the end of a cycle suggest ergonomics adjustements for the same reasons that technical validations can induce fonctionnal adjustments. This method was applied and validated on a project. Following the description of the method, this paper introduces project members experience feedbacks. Copyright © 2010 ACM.},

A linear programming method called Data Envelopment Analysis was used to compare the application of the Extreme Programming system development methodology in different organizations. According to the results of the analysis, it was possible to classify organizations' use of Extreme Programming as efficient or inefficient.

Grounded in the agility and diffusion of innovations literature, this research introduces a measure of process agility within the software development domain and relates it to constructs previously employed in the innovation literature. For agile methods, our study has provided empirical support for the proposal that agile development methods lead to developers' beliefs that they are less complex, more compatible and provide increased benefits. Since developers believe that agility leads to increased benefits, they will be more likely to accept agile methods. For practitioners, this study provides valuable insights into the underlying factors that influence a developer's beliefs about agile methods.},

affiliation={Center for Digital Imaging, Inc., Fairfield, CT, United States; Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, Netherlands},
abstract={Instituting digital asset management (DAM) in cultural heritage institutions tends to be a major IT initiative. What is often overlooked is that DAM in isolation merely provides a resource intensive organizational tool for digital assets within the institution. The more important aspects of a DAM implementation are the workflow processes and procedures that are integrated into the application, the links the application makes internally and externally to other institutional systems, and ultimately how the implementation changes and enhances the institution's business processes surrounding the use of digital assets. When the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, decided to undertake a DAM implementation as part of their revamped digital imaging program, their final solution combined MediaBin, an enterprise-level DAM product from Autonomy, with data links to their collection management system, AdLib, and Microsoft SharePoint, a collaboration and business process portal toolkit, with an eye toward further integration in the future. I was commissioned as an outside consultant to help the Rijksmuseum Archive conceptualize their internal business workflows and processes involving digital assets; as they existed and how they might change and be enhanced. Working with the ICT Director, Rob Hendriks, we evaluated systems to layer the actual tasks of these workflows and processes on top of the chosen DAM software. The choice of the DAM application was influenced by its ability to connect to possible front ends, SharePoint being only one of the choices evaluated. The museum had prior experience working with SharePoint making its choice a logical decision. The integration that resulted has been in use for about two years, with additional functionality added in subsequent versions. It has allowed the museum to be more efficient and consider new opportunities. Training of users was fast-tracked; most users never see the MediaBin interface which can be confusing for non-imaging personnel. Users interact with a simplified SharePoint interface, trimmed down to basic functionality. SharePoint also serves as the enabler for request forms, project tracking, and order fulfillment. The model we will describe in our presentation is in many ways an evolution of DAM ahead of the actual maturation of DAM applications, especially for the cultural heritage sector. In the future, a traditional DAM application could be best of breed components rather than an integrated system; a file system or repository like Fedora, a metadata container or wrapper within a database, and a digital asset transformation engine like ImageMagick. Interfaces and workflows to suit the audience would be layered on top via products like SharePoint or open source wiki or CMS systems. The key differentiator for each institution would be the business processes and workflows that make the integration truly functional for the organization, and the flexibility to plug in other systems which feed data to, or need access from asset records. What we have accomplished in a still somewhat traditional manner could be pushed toward a more deconstructed, open and agile development environment.},

abstract={Inadequate use of project management techniques in software development can be traced to the lack of efficient education strategies for managers [1]. Software development processes are complex and therefore it is hard to predict how changes made to some part of the process can affect the overall outcome of the process. Introducing change in the process is often time consuming and there is no assurance that the change implemented will result in an improvement. Simulation of software development process provides an easy way for managers to test the different configurations of the process and understand the effects of various policies. Using agent directed simulation to mimic the software development process at the individual level also would enable us to introduce a new phase of software development without having to change the simulation code. This simulation would start with a given number of agents initialized by the user. At any point of time, the user may change the number of developers or assign developers on different phases of the software development depending on their performance and capabilities.

abstract={The implementation of a Business Intelligence (BI) solution in an environment where traditional barriers prohibit incorporating analytics in operational and strategic decision making remains challenging. The solution must overcome a very tight budget, severe restrictions on data access due to security concerns, and a tradition of using conventional legacy tools for primary reporting. We propose a method that minimizes both the ETL (Extract Transform Load) and data warehousing components of the solution and allows for agile development and incremental adoption. This is achieved by taking advantage of the organization's current legacy reporting structure as the basis and then building a BI reporting layer on top for a high level view of the information. Our methodology has demonstrated benefits in the form of reduced complexity, reduced risk, reduced cost in both time and money, and a solution that provides a greater return on investment. © 2010 i-Society.},

abstract={We introduce new rules for channel access and a new metric for use with the routing protocol for ad hoc networks that utilize multiple heterogeneous channels. The networks we investigate employ frequency-agile radios that are able to change their carrier frequency and chip rate over a wide range of possibilities. These protocols have the capability to increase the network performance of an ad hoc network by utilizing the multiple bands available to the network. We show that our jointly designed channel-access and routing protocols significantly increase network performance over an approach in which the channel-access and routing protocols are not designed to cooperate. We also show that the channel-access and routing protocols should be adapted jointly according to the specific characteristics of the network. ©2010 IEEE.},

In order to understand user's requirements more accurately, User Centered Design (UCD) is introduced into software development for a while. But this cooperation still can't satisfy market-oriented software implementation due to problems such as delivery delay and nasty conflicts. As to solve the low efficiency of communication between UCDs and developers, we bring up this new combined model, Inter-combined Model as we called. This model also aims to shorten the knowledge transfer from designers to developers. In this paper, we describe the working process of Inter-combined Model and illustrate it with a project.

We model the Security Rule using production rules and employ the model to analyze the iTrust requirements for legal compliance. Using the framework, we were able to identify 13 functional and 5 non-functional requirements that were previously overlooked using an agile driven software engineering approach.

abstract={Despite advances in situational method engineering, many software organizations continue to adopt an ad-hoc mix of method fragments from well-known development methods such as Scrum or XP, based on their perceived suitability to project or organizational needs. With the increasing availability of empirical evidence on the success or failure of various software development methods and practices under different situational conditions, it now becomes feasible to make this evidence base systematically accessible to practitioners so that they can make informed decisions when creating situational methods for their organizations. This paper proposes a framework for evaluating the suitability of candidate method fragments prior to their adoption in software projects. The framework makes use of collected knowledge about how each method fragment can contribute to various project objectives, and what requisite conditions must be met for the fragment to be applicable. Pre-constructed goal models for the selected fragments are retrieved from a repository, merged, customized with situational factors, and then evaluated using a qualitative evaluation procedure adapted from goal-oriented requirements engineering. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a software cost estimation model for agile development which can help estimate concrete development costs for the desired features of a product and track the project progress dynamically. In general, existing cost estimation methods for agile developments used a story point. Because it is relative value, the estimation results tend to be easily fluctuated by the small variation of the baseline story point. For tracking project's progress, the velocity was measured to check the progress and was used to make plan for the iteration and the releases of the project. The proposed method in this paper provides the systematic estimation and dynamic tracking methodology for agile projects. To estimate the effort of a project development, function points are used in addition to the story point. The function points are determined based on the user stories of desired features of the product. We adopt the Kalman filter algorithm for tracking project progress. The remaining function points at a certain point during the project are modeled as the state space model for the Kalman filter. The daily variation of the function point is observed and inputted to the Kalman Filter for providing concrete estimation and velocity. Moreover we validate the better performance of our model by comparing with traditional methods through a case study. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={The topic of enterprise architecture (EA) has been gaining significant attention from both academia and industry due to the inefficiency of current IT architectures to cope with rapid changes in business environment. In order to turn existing EA into efficient and agile one, it is necessary to institutionalize an EA based on well-established enterprise architecture frameworks (EAFs) into the enterprise. In this paper, we propose EA institutionalization processes and its metric based assessment for implemented EA based on the currently available EA frameworks. In the EA processes, we define institutionalization strategies specific to organizations' goals, target architecture based on their baseline architecture, and transition plan for institutionalization. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Nowadays collaboration among organizations in the so called Virtual Organizations (VOs) is the most advanced form to make business. Their emergence and growing are closely related to integrated information and communication technology (ICT). One of the promising approaches to carry out the agility and flexibility in VO creation is defined under the assumption of a VO Breeding Environment (VBE). To support such agile organizations, an efficient IT system and methodologies should be set in order to facilitate their daily management activities. Service-oriented software technologies provide promising means to regulate and enforce coordination of cross-organisational business services interactions but lack organizational abstractions and methodology. This paper proposes a framework for collaborative network coordination in the VBEs's context. The proposed framework satisfies flexibility and agility requirements of virtual organization using a multi layer approach combining VBE management systems layer that assist flexible VO creation, a semantic interoperability layer essential for promoting integration on the basis of common language that describe VO concepts and inherent dependencies, and a service oriented layer that introduces the concept of service domain that encapsulates business processes fitting VO requirements. © 2010 IFIP.},

abstract={Applying agile methodology in large software development projects introduces many challenges. For example, one may expect that the combination of autonomous teams and the necessity for an overall organizational control structure may lead to conflicts, and one may expect that Agile's informal means of knowledge sharing breaks down as the number of project participants increases. Such issues may in turn compromise the project's productivity. In order to better understand potential threats to productivity in large agile development projects, we conducted repertory grid interviews with 13 project members on their perceptions of threats to productivity. The project was a large software development project consisting of 11 Scrum teams from three different subcontractors. The repertory grid sessions produced 100 issues, which were content analyzed into 10 main problem areas: (1) Restraints on collaboration due to contracts, ownership, and culture, (2) Architectural and technical qualities are given low priority, (3) Conflicts between organizational control and flexibility, (4) Volatile and late requirements from external parties, (5) Lack of a shared vision for the end product, (6) Limited dissemination of functional knowledge, (7) Excessive dependencies within the system, (8) Overloading of key personnel, (9) Difficulties in maintaining well-functioning technical environments, (10) Difficulties in coordinating test and deployment with external parties. Using critical-case reasoning, we claim that projects deploying agile practices in projects with less favorable conditions than those enjoyed in the current project, and that are larger and more complex, are likely to face similar challenges. © 2010 ACM.},

Investigating process conformance during training and understanding if programmers are able and willing to follow the specific steps are crucial to evaluating whether the process improves various software product quality factors. In this paper we present a process model independent approach to detect process non-conformance. Our approach is based on non-intrusively collected data captured by a version control system and provides the project manager with timely updates. Further, we provide evidence of the applicability of our approach by investigating process conformance in a five day training class on eXtreme Programming (XP) practices at the Leibniz Universität Hannover. Our results show that the approach enabled researchers to formulate minimal intrusive methods to check for conformance and that for the majority of the investigated XP practices violations could be detected. © 2010 ACM.},

abstract={In order to improve the information system development process many companies have adopted system development methodologies. Various evaluation methods and frameworks exist in the literature to assist companies during their adoption phase. However, a need was identified to evaluate the efficiency of a system development methodology after adoption. In an era where there is a reappraisal of the usefulness of system development methodologies it is essential to have a valid and reliable method of evaluation. The aim of this paper is to propose an evaluation model to measure post-implementation efficiency of a software development methodology. Data Envelopment Analysis, a linear programming method, is investigated as a means to evaluate efficiency of a SDM after adoption. This paper focus on the Scrum software development methodology as it is a popular methodology in use today. With Data Envelopment Analysis it is possible to classify different companies' use of Scrum as efficient or inefficient. The results also make it possible to identify specific areas in a company that needs improvement. These individual recommendations can be applied to increase the post-implementation efficiency of a company's systems development methodology. © 2010 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper seeks to describe the application of the Agile software development approach to rapidly develop and deploy a variety of innovative IT applications. Design/methodology/approach: The Agile approach is flexible and iterative with continuous feedback and constant communication. It is also marked by frequent and short delivery schedules. An Agile team of staff and students was formed for different projects, and visual tools were used to show process and progress. Team members were also co-located (situated in the same space), a key element that allowed faster and direct communication. Within the Agile framework, the Crystal Clear methodology was selected, which is based on team size and criticality of the application to develop the workflow and iterative processes. Findings: The Agile approach is particularly suited to innovation development and creative teams for rapid development of products, services, and technology. However, its acceptance is dependent on organizational culture and nature of application. Research limitations/implications: As a next step, it would be useful to test the Agile approach in an innovative application that is on a larger scale than six team members and with a different level of criticality. Practical implications: Flexibility and adaptability are needed in managing the development of IT innovations and applications as they vary in size and complexity. The flexible and iterative Agile approach provided the framework to develop and implement these projects despite the small staff size. Originality/value: There is little in the professional literature on software development and project management approaches for small teams. The Agile approach would be of interest to an IT unit or library with limited staff resources and interested in a lightweight framework to develop and deploy innovative projects. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

We argue that, by applying principles from agile software development, which has achieved strong success in recent years, there is great potential to meet these challenges directly and, in doing so, to save money, increase efficiency, an ensure that the right decisions are being made as systems are developed and deployed. Furthermore, we suggest that this movement to "agilesystems engineering" can largely be accomplished by employing systemsengineering practices that are centered on evolutionary, end-to-end implementations of physics-based modeling and simulation. Finally, we argue that the DoD must have qualified, independent, trusted agentsthat will help it execute these improved systems engineering practices if it is to be successful.},

abstract={SOMGIS is a service oriented model which uses SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) concepts as the basic architectural concept and employs OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) standards to support GIS concerns in the organization. This model is based on relevant studies that encourage organizations to use SOA concepts and OGC standards for developing GIS (Geographic Information System) software applications. These studies show that such combination can overcome most of todays GIS application development problems such as lack of interoperability, agility, and business alignment. SOMGIS (Service Oriented model for GIS Software Architecture) consists of a reference model, conceptual model, and a design method. Reference model shows roadmap of any future architectural and design efforts. Conceptual model introduces a conceptual service oriented solution for reference model. Finally, service oriented design method leads organizations to reach the solution through specific process. As the result SOMGIS provides general software architecture, which covers both real enterprise requirements and GIS concerns in the organization. It is an agile model with proper patterns which increase interoperability and reusability across the enterprise. Also the model has the capability of adopting itself with any organizations and be customized to any specific GIS applications. © 2010 IEEE.},

The principles and concepts of stakeholder theory can be applied to software development organizations to give managers a better understanding of the diverse community of stakeholders that influence product development efforts. A deeper understanding of the broad community of stakeholders can help an organization that is transitioning to agile methods by highlighting the stakeholders that are affected. This paper describes the application of stakeholder theory to product development organizations in the context of a global product development company undergoing a multi-year transition to agile development. A model is presented for mapping stakeholders into stakeholder groups, and for quantifying the influence of stakeholders.

abstract={Agile organizations focus on developing software systems that satisfy their current customer base, without worrying about best practices to handle variations of requirements in the system. Scaling agile methods up to adopt variability management practices in their traditional form is challenging. In this paper, we discuss the challenges and we contribute a lightweight, iterative approach that enables agile organizations to manage variability on demand in a reactive manner. The approach relies on agile practices like iterative development, refactoring, and continuous integration and testing. We present a case study to show how the approach was used to handle variability arising from technical and usability issues, and we provide a discussion of the advantages and limitations of the approach. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={The benefits ascribed to Agile methods are attractive to software engineers working in the safety-critical software domain. There is limited industrial experience and evidence of successful applications of Agile methods in this domain; however, academic research has identified some of the key challenges of their adoption and application, and has started to present feasibility studies. In this paper, we propose an iterative approach for developing safety-critical software, making two novel contributions. Firstly, we address the notion of up-front design in safety-critical software development, and describe the characteristics of an up-front design that is minimal from the perspective of achieving safety objectives. Secondly, we identify a key difficulty of using iterative development for building safety-critical software, and present a way to develop both a software system and a safety argument iteratively. We also give details of a proof-of-concept example illustrating the use of the approach. © 2010 IEEE.},

This method is based on learning and communication theory, together with situated cognition. It was developed in the context of agile software development practice. Using this method, we found evidence that physical artefacts help team members to define contexts within their practice, which in turn become part of their contingency plan for communicating during specific contexts of communication. A contingency plan is a set of communicative actions that members take in future events that are possible but not intended, including the unanticipated.

With two-tone nonlinear characterization test, the diplexer (with higher biased voltage) is found to introduce, in Tx frequency band, a high level of intermodulation product (IIP3). A better insertion loss inf passbands is observed for a lower room temperature. Measuredf insertion loss of our fabricated diplexer is obtained between 5.3 to 2.89 dB and 5.2 to 3.7 dB over the tuning frequency range for the Tx and Rx channels filters bands, respectively.

abstract={Due to the unique characteristics of GIS, the architecture of a distributed Geographic Information System (GIS) must be built centered on GIS and RS data. Service Oriented Architecture(SOA) is used to architect a Distributed GIS which integrates multiple GIS service from disparate domains such as Google Map, Bing Map and custom map defined by ESRI. As long as these map services are published on the network using same predefined tiling scheme and in the form of standardized webservice, they can be aggregated together to form a mashup map. In the same time, Rich Internet Application (RIA) is incorporated in Representation Tier to deal with formatted messages passed back by back-end SOA in this study. SOA and RIA can cooperate together to deal with real-time interaction between server and client, improving the user interface greatly and making the whole application more agile. In this paper, firstly we introduce and analyze the characteristics of SOA and RIA. Then a GIS architecture combing SOA and GIS is designed, simultaneously several key technologies are also discussed. In the end, s prototype application has been developed. This experiment proves that this GIS architecture posted in this study is efficient and feasible.},

abstract={The heavy reliance on the human factor in agile methods poses new challenges for organizations intent on adopting them. Improper role assignment, neglected team dependencies, and overlooked required skills have all been reported as reasons for failures during the introduction of an agile method. Current process modelling languages are not designed for describing or analyzing such human-related issues, and thus, provide little assistance to organizations in the process of adopting an agile method. This paper advocates the use of goal-oriented modeling techniques for depicting social aspects of agile methods. These social models can be used to identify the key factors that contribute to the success or failure of an agile method, thus providing guidance early during the introduction of the method in an organization. The approach is illustrated using the Serum process. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Use cases are a key technique to elicit software requirements from the point of view of the user of a system. Their prevalence is noticeable ever since the onset of agile programming techniques. Within SOA projects however, business process models are used for capability analysis and gap detection. Business process models present a global view of the system and hence are more suited for gap detection. Therefore, in practice both these forms of requirements continue to be useful and coexist. Often in big software projects and in distributed development environment such coexisting requirement specifications can grow out of synch. We present here a technique to semi-automatically transform use cases into business processes and to create mapping between them. By preserving the mapping between these forms one can enforce consistency between the two forms of requirements. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Computing has reached the time of distributed applications everywhere. Service-oriented architectures are more and more used to organize such complex and highly dynamic applications into business processes calling services discovered in registries at load-time. In this context, Quality of Service (QoS) and agility in business processes become key issues. Instead of binding business processes to services at load-time, this paper proposes to monitor sets of candidate services for their current QoS and to choose among them at call-time. This new form of late-binding paves the way to more agile and robust applications called adaptive business processes. Besides the conceptual background and implementation of this late-binding in an industrial-strength web service platform, this paper presents the LCP-net formalism introduced to provide programmers with a mean to express qualitatively their preferences among the different QoS properties of services, hence tackling the multicriteria decision making arising from the run-time choice among candidate services given several unrelated QoS properties. © 2010 IEEE.},

We propose a tabu search algorithm to solve this NP-hard problem. This one is formulated as a constrained optimization problem and involves stereoscopic and time window visibility constraints; and a convex evaluation function that increases its hardness. To obtain a wide-ranging and an efficient exploration of the search space, we sample it by consistent and saturated configurations. Our algorithm is also hybridized with a systematic search that uses partial enumerations. To increase the solution quality, we introduce and solve a secondary problem; the minimization of the sum of the transition durations between the acquisitions. Upper bounds are also calculated by a dynamic programming algorithm on a relaxed problem. The obtained results show the efficiency of our approach. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Context: Job rotation is a widely known approach to increase knowledge redundancy but empirical evidence regarding introduction and adoption in software development is scant. A lack of knowledge redundancy is a limiting factor for collaboration, flexibility, and coordination within teams and within the organization. Objective: The scientific objective of this investigation was to explore benefits and challenges with improving knowledge redundancy among developers participating in job rotation. There were two practical objectives; (a) to establish customer support as a legitimate organizational function that would shield developers from support enquiries, and (b) to contribute to improved flexibility in project staffing by enabling overlapping product experience among developers. Method: We used action research to integrate organizational change with scientific inquiry. During a period of eighteen weeks, nine developers rotated to customer support. We collected data throughout the period of collaboration; in meetings, from comprehensive interviews, and from customer support work logs. Results: Perceptions of reduced efficiency and unnecessary redundancy outweighed benefits of shielding and learning about different products. Although there were strong indications of increased knowledge redundancy, the benefits were not sufficient to justify job rotation. Job rotation was abandoned after the trial period. Conclusions: Job rotation can contribute to improved knowledge redundancy. Benefits of knowledge redundancy include innovation stemming from integration of different knowledge domains and improved appreciation of organizational concerns. However, knowledge redundancy incurs a collective cost that must be amortized and legitimized by the organization. An adoption process that accommodates open and trustful discussion among all involved stakeholders is therefore encouraged. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The agile workflow technology deals with flexible workflow adaptation and overriding, in case of foreseen as well as unforeseen changes and problems in the operating business environment. One key issue that an agile workflow system should address is Business Process (BP) monitoring. This consists in properly highlighting and organizing non-compliances and adaptations with respect to the default process schema. Such an activity can be the starting point for other very critical tasks, such as quality assessment and process reengineering. In this paper, we introduce an automated support to BP monitoring, which exploits the Case-based Reasoning (CBR) methodology. CBR is particularly well suited for managing exceptional situations, and has been proposed in the literature for process change reuse and workflow adaptation support. Our work extends these functionalities by retrieving traces of process execution similar to the current one, which can then be automatically clustered. Retrieval and clustering results can provide support both to end users, in the process instance execution phase, and to process engineers, in (formal) process quality evaluation and long term process schema redefinition. Our approach in practice is illustrated by means of a case study in the field of stroke management. © 2010 IFIP.},

Test cases guide the system implementation and can be executed automatically after software changes (continuous integration & build strategy). However, TDD processes need to be adapted to control automation systems engineering, where real-world systems are challenging to model and to test automatically. In this paper we introduce an adapted TDD process from the business software engineering domain to industrial automation engineering. We identify a set of UML models that enable the systematic derivation of test cases. Based on an initial empirical study we evaluate the adapted TDD process based on an industrial use case to identify strength and limitation of this approach. Major results of the study were that UML models enabled effective test case derivation in the study context. © 2010 IEEE.},

CMM is a well recognized and globally accepted standard in software development to process control, quality improvement, and measurement of software firm's capability. Therefore, Pakistani software firms (SMEs) are striving to achieve the CMM certifications to earn profit from offshore clients. In fact, CMM certification is not easy to adopt for all level of firms. Pakistan software industry is at its initial stage, so it is not recommendable to jump for CMM by software firms (SMEs) directly. The present research paper suggests that these software firms (SMEs) should go for adaptation of agile development methodology for excellent performance on the foot steps of CMM. In this way, software firms (SMEs) can leads toward CMM after agile maturity. The authors used the eXtreme Programming (XP) as an example that proves Agile Development Methodology can well fit the CMM framework and software development firms (SMEs) can achieve their objectives to participate in offshore outsourcing phenonmena. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={The successful roll-out of the control software for a complex NIR imager/spectrograph with MOS calls for flexible development strategies due to changing requirements during different phases of the project. A waterfall strategy used in the beginning has to change to a more iterative and agile process in the later stages. The choice of an appropriate program language as well as suitable software layout is crucial. For example the software has to accomplish multiple demands of different user groups, including a high level of flexibility for later changes and extensions. Different access levels to the instrument are mandatory to afford direct control mechanisms for lab operations and inspections of the instrument as well as tools to accomplish efficient science observations. Our hierarchical software structure with four layers of increasing abstract levels and the use of an object oriented language ideally supports these requirements. Here we describe our software architecture, the software development process, the different access levels and our commissioning experiences with LUCIFER 1. © 2010 SPIE.},

abstract={Coalition formation is an active and essential component for multi-agent systems (MAS) in task-oriented domains in which tasks can be too complicated to be accomplished by a single agent with insufficient resources. By forming a coalition, agents are able to cooperate and combine resources to complete tasks that are impossible to accomplish alone within a given time bound. For example, in virtual enterprises, small and agile enterprises can provide more services and make more profits than an individual can. In many multi-task environments, especially in parallel multi-task environments, an individual abundant in resources is inclined to undertake more than one task to make more profits and participate in multiple virtual organizations (MVOs) at the same time, where every member has to decide how to allocate different parts of its resources to serve multiple different project tasks. Such overlapping property is a very intractable problem in practical decision making, and to the best of our knowledge, current coalition formation algorithms typically exclude the possibility of having overlapping coalitions, that is an agent can only be a member of one coalition at any given time, leading to waste of resources, preventing the system from efficiently allocating all agents' resources, and limiting the scope of their applications in real-world scenarios. Indeed, overlapping coalition formation (OCF) is an important research question, because MVOs are very crucial and beneficial in parallel multi-task domains where only a few selected individuals have rare, but highly demanded, resources. With this in mind, we develop a discrete particle swarm optimization based algorithm to solve the OCF problem in MVOs, applicable for more complex virtual enterprises environments. We introduce a two-dimensional binary encoding scheme and propose a novel repairing strategy for resolving conflicts over the usage of joint resources among overlapping coalitions. With this novel strategy for cooperative conflict resolution, any invalid encoding can be adjusted into a valid one without any resource conflict. Finally, simulations are conducted to show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Our focus was on the concepts which allow the software organization to successfully apply agile development methods or plan-driven methods. We also observed the test process enhancements and hindrances, which originate in the selected development method. We interviewed 12 organizations, which were selected to represent different polar types of software production. The interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed for further analysis. The study yielded hypotheses which were derived by applying the qualitative grounded theory method. The results indicated that in practice, agile methods can improve the position of testing through the early involvement of testing activities in development, and also have a positive influence on end-product satisfaction. By applying these results, organizations can improve their processes and avoid pitfalls when transitioning to agile methods. © 2010 ACM.},

An ideal goal is to encapsulate these requirements into a high-level abstraction, which can be used to drive large-scale adaptation of the underlying software implementation. Model Driven Engineering (MDE) is one of the enabling techniques that support this objective. One of the important parts in this process is the creation of Platform Independent Model (PIM). There are several approaches on this matter. However there is still the absence of clear documentation on the methods especially when the purpose is aimed for generic PIMs in a specific domain. This article introduces an approach to developing PIMs by using UML, OCL and promotes agility by applying agile modeling for this purpose. A practical example will be demonstrated. © 2010 IEEE.},

The findings from the literature are validated by and compared to an industrial inventory. Based on the validation and the comparison, new approaches for agile adoption in large settings have been identified: incremental agile adoption approaches combining both bottom-up and top-down strategies; the important role of identified key practices that enable quick feedback and adaptation in the early adoption stages; and approaches derived from the multidimensional nature of agility. These approaches make possible to overcome the restrictions of conventional agile methods. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

For many practitioners, agile software development is about picking up fragments from various agile methods, assembling them as a light-weight process, and deploying them in their software projects. Given the growing number of published empirical studies about using agile in different project situations, it is now possible to gain a more realistic view of what each agile method fragment can accomplish, and the necessary requisites for its successful deployment. With the aim of making this knowledge more accessible, this paper introduces a repository of agile method fragments, which organizes the evidential knowledge according to their objectives and requisites. The knowledge is gathered through systematic review of empirical studies which investigated the enactment of agile methods in various project situations. In addition, the paper proposes a modeling paradigm for visualizing the stored knowledge of method fragments, to facilitate the subsequent assembly task. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

However, it has not been described and researched in detail. [Principal ideas/results] This paper introduces BPL, examines how it can be used for prioritizing requirements and assesses its prioritization process quality by comparing it to another prioritization technique. A facilitating tool was developed and applied in two small Dutch product software companies.

The UK's National Programme for IT has made great strides in achieving interoperability; through linkage to a national electronic spine. However, there has been criticism of the usability of the applications in the clinical environment. Method: Analysis of the procurement and assurance process to explore whether they predetermine usability. Results: Processes separate developers from users, and test products against theoretical assurance models of use rather than simulate or pilot in a clinical environment. The current process appears to be effective for back office systems and high risk applications, but too inflexible for developing applications for the clinical setting. Conclusions: For clinical applications agile techniques are more appropriate. Usability testing should become an integrated part of the contractual process and be introduced earlier in the development process. © 2010 European Federation for Medical Informatics.

abstract={Software testing is a major source of expense in software projects and a proper testing process is a critical ingredient in the cost-efficient development of high-quality software. Contemporary aspects, such as the introduction of a more lightweight process, trends towards distributed development, and the rapid increase of software in embedded and safety-critical systems, challenge the testing process in unexpected manners. To our knowledge, there are very few studies focusing on these aspects in relation to testing as perceived by different contributors in the software development process. This paper qualitatively and quantitatively analyses data from an industrial questionnaire survey, with a focus on current practices and preferences on contemporary aspects of software testing. Specifically, the analysis focuses on perceptions of the software testing process in different categories of respondents. Categorization of respondents is based on safety-criticality, agility, distribution of development, and application domain. While confirming some of the commonly acknowledged facts, our findings also reveal notable discrepancies between preferred and actual testing practices. We believe continued research efforts are essential to provide guidelines in the adaptation of the testing process to take care of these discrepancies, thus improving the quality and efficiency of the software development. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Agile software development methods have proven to be a substantial catalyst for improvements in software quality, speed of delivery, and fitness for use, and are a driver behind the IBM Smarter Planet $^{\rm TM}$ initiative, which involves intelligent approaches that address the needs of a world that is becoming increasingly interconnected and instrumented. Software vendors who use a traditional or waterfall approach (i.e., sequential software development process) for requirement analysis and development often find that they cannot react with sufficient speed to meet rapidly changing market demand. As a result, stakeholders must wait for the vendor to complete a lengthy development cycle, which, when complete, may miss the market window for the software or fail to adequately address other needs of these stakeholders. Agile development methods, as practiced across geographically diverse and broad development teams at IBM, directly address this issue. One purpose of this paper is simply to provide a brief high-level overview and record of the adoption of these practices and methods across a large company, i.e., the IBM Corporation. © 2010 IBM.},

abstract={Roy Rubenstein explains how operators are looking forward to the holy grail of dynamic optical networks that can reconfigure themselves to provision capacity and restore faults. Improving switching at the optical layer has been an ongoing challenge, but new more-capable photonic switch elements - dubbed reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers (ROADM) - coupled with control plane and management software promise finally to deliver configurable optical meshed networks. Operators such as AT&T and Verizon have long adopted tunable transponders, another key optical component needed for agile optical networking. Such a transponder can be tuned to any DWDM wavelength, yet when plugged into a ROADM it becomes restricted in operating wavelength and direction. Despite the limited flexibility, ROADMs benefit operators' networks. Wavelengths can remain in the optical domain, passing through intermediate locations without using transponders and saving on costly optical/electrical conversions.},

abstract={Although testing is one of the most important activities in software development, especially in projects which emphasize agile development, the basic approach used to define and report tests has changed little since JUnit was introduced over a decade ago. JUnit and its derivatives such as NUnit significantly simplify the task of programming tests but still leave the test logic tangled up with program scaffolding, making it difficult to see and validate. On the other hand, recently introduced validation oriented approaches, such as FIT, provide a much more concise and easy to understand description of test logic, but cannot cope with code-level testing. In this paper we present a new metaphor for test definition and reporting, referred to as "test sheets", that combines the expressive strength of JUnit with the visual simplicity of tabular approaches such as FIT. After discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the technologies used today we present the test sheet approach using some simple examples. © 2010 IEEE.},

On the one hand, to avoid frequent updates of the tests, test-driven development requires a degree of stability in the application under development, whereas GUIs are very likely to change during development. On the other hand, the easiest way of creating GUI tests - using a capture/replay tool - requires the GUI to exist. This paper introduces a new approach to user-interface test-driven development, wherein a capture-replay tool is used to record test scripts from lowfidelity prototypes. This allows GUI tests to be written simply and without requiring that the GUI exist first. © 2010 IEEE.},

While build systems play such a crucial role in software development and maintenance, they have been largely ignored by software evolution researchers. With a firm understanding of build system aging processes, project managers could allocate personnel and resources to build system maintenance tasks more effectively, reducing the build maintenance overhead on regular development activities. In this paper, we study the evolution of ANT build systems from two perspectives: (1) a static perspective, where we examine the build system specifications using software metrics adopted from the source code domain; and (2) a dynamic perspective where representative sample build runs are conducted and their output logs are analyzed. Case studies of four open source ANT build systems with a combined history of 152 releases show that not only do ANT build systems evolve, but also that they need to react in an agile manner to changes in the source code. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Purpose: Development of library digital initiatives increasingly requires integration of new technologies and collaboration between staff to accomplish specialized responsibilities. Yet, as responsibilities have evolved, the software tools used to fulfill them have largely failed to keep pace. This paper aims to show how UNLV Libraries overcame these challenges by developing a collaborative workflow model in a team with mixed technical skills. Design/methodology/approach: The paper offers a case study of one library's effort to transform inefficient web development processes in the digital library unit into an agile, collaborative team workflow through the development of a tool (dmBridge) that helps to reduce redundancies and encourage cooperation in the digital library design process. Findings: dmBridge came about in response to the growing necessity to create a sustainable digital library workflow within a framework capable of accommodating advanced customizability and relatively simple web development for CONTENTdm digital collections. Practical implications: As libraries seek to extend technology and digitization partnerships and cultivate successful grant funding, the authors demonstrate how development of tools like dmBridge can deliver an improved user experience, boost project efficiency, and support the strategic goals of the institution. Originality/value: dmBridge fills a need for a more modern, feature-rich, customizable digital collections framework. In doing so, it has brought about a considerable transformation in digitization projects workflow and resource provisioning. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Cognitive radios are becoming reality also in implementation domain. Besides the need for hardware reconfigurability and the capability to sense spectrum opportunities, adaptability in the MAC designs is required so that the wireless communication systems can support cognitive radio functionalities. In this demo paper, we introduce a MAC design framework enabling fast composition of MAC protocols which are best fitted to the application requirements, communication capabilities of the radio, and current regulations and policies. Our design is based on the decomposition principle and allows on-the-fly realization of the required MAC protocol from a set of basic functional components. By exposing extended metadata and hardware functionalities for the MAC implementation through our granular components, together with the support for run-time re-configuration, spectrum agile and cognitive MAC solutions can be easily realized. We validate our approach through realization of a few MAC solutions on the WARP board originally from Rice University, USA. We also demonstrate the ease of MAC realization, fast real-time adaptation based on the spectral characteristics and high degree of code reuse. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Managing changing business environments and requirements in Information Systems (IS) development is becoming increasingly important. IS development project courses could thus benefit from the infusion of agile, flexible, and adaptable processes. This article reports two years of continuous effort in refining the IS development project course in the National University of Singapore to illustrate how undergraduate students could be effectively taught the agile IS development approach. The course design process was based on the system approach model to instructional design and followed the principles of instructional events suggested by Dick and Carey [1991] and Gagne et al. [1992]. Input from students, as well as pedagogic principles drawn from the extant literature, were used to rigorously refine the course design over time. The final course design exhibits five distinctive characteristics. The two most important characteristics were (1) the adoption of a hybrid agile methodology incorporating the best practices in both coding and project management drawn from three established agile methodologies, and (2) the introduction of requirement shocks at appropriate junctures to train students to react to changes in business requirements. The effectiveness of the course design was assessed using objective measures of learning operationalized as the numerical scores obtained by students. Statistical analysis results indicate that the students who were taught using the final course design obtained higher scores than those who were taught with the initial design. Our course design effort was, therefore, deemed successful. © 2010 by the authors.},

The ICM emphasizes architecting systems (or DSOSs) to encapsulate subsystems (or systems) undergoing the most rapid change, and having agile systems engineers handle longer-range change traffic to rebaseline the plans for future increments. Systems engineers do this, while largely plan-driven teams develop and continuously verify and validate (V&V) the current increment, as is usually required for safe or secure software. Our approach for estimating software development cost of systems is the Constructive Incremental Commitment Cost Model (COINCOMO) and its tool, which currently implements together in one tool the Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO II), and the Constructive Phased Schedule and Effort Model (COPSEMO). © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Introduction Organizations undertaking software development are often reminded that successful practice depends on a number of non-technical issues that are managerial, cultural and organizational in nature. These issues cover aspects from appropriate corporate structure, through software process development and standardization to effective collaborative practice. Since the articulation of the 'software crisis' in the late-1960s, significant effort has been put into addressing problems related to the cost, time and quality of software development via the application of systematic processes and management practices for software engineering. Early efforts resulted in prescriptive structured methods, which have evolved and expanded over time to embrace consortia/company-led initiatives such as the Unified Modeling Language and the Unified Process alongside formal process improvement frameworks such as the International Standards Organization's 9000 series, the Capability Maturity Model and SPICE. More recently, the philosophy behind traditional plan-based initiatives has been questioned by the agile movement, which seeks to emphasize the human and craft aspects of software development over and above the engineering aspects. Agile practice is strongly collaborative in its outlook, favoring individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan (see Sidebar 1). Early experience reports on the use of agile practice suggest some success in dealing with the problems of the software crisis, and suggest that plan-based and agile practice are not mutually exclusive. Indeed, flexibility may arise from this unlikely marriage in an aim to strike a balance between the rigor of traditional plan-based approaches and the need for adaptation of those to suit particular development situations. With this in mind, this article surveys the current practice in software engineering alongside perceptions of senior development managers in relation to agile practice in order to understand the principles of agility that may be practiced implicitly and their effects on plan-based approach. © 2010 ACM.},

abstract={To be relevant to the goals of an enterprise, an industrial software engineering research organization must identify problems of interest to, and find solutions that have an impact on, the software development organizations within the company. Using a systematic measurement program both to identify the problems and assess the impact of solutions is key to satisfying this need. Avaya has had such a program in place for about seven years. Every year we produce an annual report known as the State of Software in Avaya that describes software development trends throughout the company and that contains prioritized recommendations for improving Avaya's software development capabilities. We start by identifying the goals of the enterprise and use the goal-question-metric approach to identify the measures to compute. The result is insight into the enterprise's problems in software development, recommendations for improving the development process, and problems that require research to solve. We will illustrate the process with examples from the Software Technology Research Department in Avaya Labs whose purpose is to improve the state of software development and know it. "Know it" means that improvement should be subjectively evident and objectively quantifiable. "Know it" also means that one must be skilled at identifying the data sources, performing the appropriate analyses to answer the questions of interest, and validating that the data are accurate and appropriate for the purpose. Examples will include how and why we developed a measure of software quality that appeals to customers, how and why we are studying the effectiveness of distributed software development, and how and why we are helping development organizations to adopt iterative development methods. We will also discuss how we keep the company and the department apprised of the current strengths and weaknesses of software development in Avaya through the publication of the annual Stateof Software in Avaya Report. Our purpose is both to provide a model for assessment that others may emulate, based on seven years of experience, and to spotlight analyses and conclusions that we feel are common to software development today. © Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2009.},

This paper outlines the process used to develop a user-friendly, free, Web-based resource (Assessment Center SM) for storage, retrieval, organization, sharing, and administration of patient-reported outcomes (PRO) instruments. Methods Joint Application Design (JAD) sessions were conducted with representatives from numerous institutions in order to supply a general wish list of features. Use Cases were then written to ensure that end user expectations matched programmer specifications. Program development included daily programmer "scrum" sessions, weekly Usability Acceptability Testing (UAT) and continuous Quality Assurance (QA) activities pre- and post-release. Results Assessment Center includes features that promote instrument development including item histories, data management, and storage of statistical analysis results.

In the same way, when it is difficult to know which test case corresponds to a given requirement, or if each and every requirement is fully covered by the test suite, we have a traceability issue that may also impact the success of the project. During the last few years, the agile community has suggested a new development paradigm in order to address this traceability issue. This approach is called Behaviour Driven Development (BDD). It is based on a new way of expressing requirements using a common language understandable by all parties at stake. After having described the Behaviour Driven Development in details, we introduce the XReq tool, an Open Source project developed by SOGILIS and part of the Open-DO project. It is designed to bring the Behaviour Driven Development to the Ada language and other statically typed languages. It also aims at facilitating the traceability of High and Low Level Tests in the context of DO-178B projects.},

abstract={Internationalisation is increasingly being seen as an organisational learning process. However, entrepreneurial enterprises tend to be smaller, more innovative and more agile than their larger counterparts. When they internationalise, entrepreneurial firms often expand at a rapid rate. The cultures of so-called 'born global' firms also appear to differ from firms that internationalise in a more gradual, stepwise fashion. This raises interesting questions about how entrepreneurial firms acquire and manage knowledge about markets, networks and capabilities in turbulent and uncertain environments and how the values embedded in organisational cultures might influence strategic choices. The following articles in this special edition of the Journal of International Entrepreneurship focus specifically on how innovative firms-particularly small and medium-sized enterprises-recognise and exploit market opportunities, how they learn from international market entry and penetration experiences to improve core capabilities and how values may influence supply chain management and start-up decisions. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Recently, there has been a noticeable increase of attention to regulatory compliance. As a result, more and more organizations are required to comply with the laws and regulations that apply to their industry sector. An important aspect of these regulations is directly related to the way by which software systems, used by regulated companies, are built, tested, and maintained. While some of these regulations require from these systems to support a very specific set of requirements, others, the focus of this paper, are concerned with the process by which the system has been built. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, for example, impose stringent requirements on the process by which software systems used in medical devices are developed. One particular focus of the FDA regulations is on having a user-centered approach for building software for medical devices through the use of well-known concepts in the area of human factor engineering. In this paper, we discuss these requirements in detail and show how Extreme Programming, an agile process, lacks the necessary practices to support them. We also propose an extension to XP, that if adopted, we believe it will address this particular need of the FDA regulations for medical device software. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Cognitive radio is a well motivated concept for improving the inefficient spectrum utilization and apparent scarcity that result from traditional spectral regulations. So far, most efforts in the cognitive radio research field focus on techniques for the enhancement of the amount of available spectrum under the stringent constraint of causing no harmful interference to legacy users. But communication reliability also can substantially benefit from the cognitive radio approach by means of agile utilization of transmission opportunities in frequency, time and space. In this paper, we present our Cognitive Agile Networking (CAN) framework that aims at achieving robust low-latency communications by introducing agility in frequency, time and space as well as learning and reasoning for optimizing network operations. In order to respect practical issues of real-world applications, we are building a COgnitive Agile Spectrum Testbed (COAST) for experiments and validations. An initial version of this testbed is introduced here and its spectral agility is demonstrated. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Many large companies, especially those in financial and insurance service sectors, approach the market with a decentralized management structure, such as by line of business or geographical market segments. However, these companies require access to distributed and possibly heterogeneous data sources for corporate level decision making. In this paper, we focus on challenges of supporting a decision support system (DSS) based on a hybrid approach (i.e. a federation system with replication of frequently accessed remote data sources) for time-sensitive agile business intelligence applications. The response time requirement (and a realistic goal) for such a DSS is near real time (i.e. 2 ∼ 3 minutes to 20 ∼ 30 minutes). The users of a DSS care about not only the response time but also the time stamp of the business operation reports since out-dated reports introduce uncertainty and risks to decision-making. Thus, the information value of a report decreases as time passes. We present a framework of correlation aware synchronization of replicas used in DSS to optimize information values of business reports as a whole. The framework exploits correlation of usage and synchronization latency of replicas in a single query and a workload of queries for an optimal synchronization schedule. We have conducted extensive evaluations based on both TPC-H and synthetic workload. The proposed correlation aware synchronization effectively improves up to 50% of information value comparing with fixed synchronization plans on average. Copyright 2010 ACM.},

Their aggressive removal of impediments (take no prisoners!) distinguishes them from Scrum implementations that are captive of their institutionalized waste. The founder of OpenView saw that maximum productivity in Scrum occurs at a sustainable pace with less hours of work per week than without Scrum.

abstract={It is essential for product software companies to decide which requirements should be included in the next release and to make an appropriate time plan of the development project. Compared to the extensive research done on requirement selection, very little research has been performed on time scheduling. In this paper, we introduce two integer linear programming models that integrate time scheduling into software release planning. Given the resource and precedence constraints, our first model provides a schedule for developing the requirements such that the project duration is minimized. Our second model combines requirement selection and scheduling, so that it not only maximizes revenues but also simultaneously calculates an on-time-delivery project schedule. Since requirement dependencies are essential for scheduling the development process, we present a more detailed analysis of these dependencies. Furthermore, we present two mechanisms that facilitate dynamic adaptation for over-estimation or under-estimation of revenues or processing time, one of which includes the Scrum methodology. Finally, several simulations based on real-life data are performed. The results of these simulations indicate that requirement dependency can significantly influence the requirement selection and the corresponding project plan. Moreover, the model for combined requirement selection and scheduling outperforms the sequential selection and scheduling approach in terms of efficiency and on-time delivery. © 2010 The Author(s).},

abstract={Context: Software development depends significantly on team performance, as does any process that involves human interaction. Objective: Most current development methods argue that teams should self-manage. Our objective is thus to provide a better understanding of the nature of self-managing agile teams, and the teamwork challenges that arise when introducing such teams. Method: We conducted extensive fieldwork for 9 months in a software development company that introduced Scrum. We focused on the human sensemaking, on how mechanisms of teamwork were understood by the people involved. Results: We describe a project through Dickinson and McIntyre's teamwork model, focusing on the interrelations between essential teamwork components. Problems with team orientation, team leadership and coordination in addition to highly specialized skills and corresponding division of work were important barriers for achieving team effectiveness. Conclusion: Transitioning from individual work to self-managing teams requires a reorientation not only by developers but also by management. This transition takes time and resources, but should not be neglected. In addition to Dickinson and McIntyre's teamwork components, we found trust and shared mental models to be of fundamental importance. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Purpose: Agile software development (ASD) is currently an emerging approach in software engineering for improving quality, initially advocated by a group of 17 software professionals who practice a set of "lightweight" methods, and share a common set of values of software development. Owing to the attractive claims of successes of the ASD approach, many traditional projects, which used to practice plan-driven software development, are gradually transitioning into ASD-based development. This paper seeks to report the results from a survey-based ex-post-facto study aimed at determining the relative importance, if any, of the changes traditional plan-driven software development projects have to undergo to adopt ASD practices. Design/methodology/approach: The study was conducted using a web-based survey with ASD practitioners who had experience of practicing plan-driven software development in the past. ASD practitioners from a wide range of industrial sectors participated in the study. Similarly, the study is not restricted to any specific organisation/project size, culture, or nationality - the respondents were widely geographically distributed across continents. Findings: The study received 241 responses, of which 165 were usable. The study did not reveal any substantial difference in importance of the four classes of changes hypothesised - changes in culture, changes in management style, changes in knowledge management strategy and changes in development processes. The authors believe that this is an important finding because it is indicative of not isolating one class of changes from another in practical transition exercises. However, another noteworthy observation was that transitioning from heavily process-centric to short, iterative, test-driven, and people-centric development was considered by the largest percentage (roughly 77 per cent) of respondents to be very important. The open-ended questions in the study also revealed three additional classes of changes: changes in personal characteristics, changes in customer attitude, and changes in knowledge and education of stakeholders. Originality/value: In this work an attempt was made to gain an understanding of the relative importance of the different critical changes that would be helpful to a project manager who is involved in the transition from traditional plan-driven software development practices to agile software development practices. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Using three case studies of organizations that have adopted agile methods in India, we highlight the importance of senior leadership vision, mentoring, and personnel selection in creating an environment that will support successful agile adoption.

Geological evidence indicated that the above-barrier populations have been isolated for 8,000-12,500 years. Genetic differentiation among below-barrier populations (F ST = 0.10, 95% C. I. 0.08-0.12) was similar to a previous study of more southern populations of this species. Above-barrier populations were highly differentiated from adjacent below-barrier populations (mean pairwise F ST = 0.28; SD 0.18) and multiple lines of evidence were consistent with asymmetric downstream gene flow that varied among streams. Each above-barrier population had reduced within-population genetic variation when compared to the adjacent below-barrier population. Within-population genetic diversity was significantly correlated with the amount of available habitat in above-barrier sites. Increased genetic differentiation of above-barrier populations with lower genetic diversity suggests that genetic drift has been the primary cause of genetic divergence. Long-term estimates of N e based on loss of heterozygosity over the time since isolation were large (3,170; range 1,077-7,606) and established an upper limit for N e if drift were the only evolutionary process responsible for loss of genetic diversity. However, it is likely that a combination of mutation, selection, and gene flow have also contributed to the genetic diversity of above-barrier populations. Contemporary above-barrier N e estimates were much smaller than long-term N e estimates, not correlated with within-population genetic diversity, and not consistent with the amount of genetic variation retained, given the approximate 10,000-year period of isolation. The populations isolated by waterfalls in this study that occur in larger stream networks have retained substantial genetic variation, which suggests that the amount of habitat in headwater streams is an important consideration for maintaining the evolutionary potential of isolated populations. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Robotic fingers, which are the key parts of robot hand, are divided into two main kinds: dexterous fingers and under-actuated fingers. Although dexterous fingers are agile, they are too expensive. Under-actuated fingers can grasp objects self-adaptively, which makes them easy to control and low cost, on the contrary, under-actuated function makes fingers feel hard to grasp things agilely enough and make many gestures. For the purpose of designing a new finger which can grasp things dexterously, perform many gestures and feel easy to control and maintain, a concept called "gesture-changeable under-actuated" (GCUA) function is put forward. The GCUA function combines the advantages of dexterous fingers and under-actuated fingers: a pre-bending function is embedded into the under-actuated finger. The GCUA finger can not only perform self-adaptive grasping function, but also actively bend the middle joint of the finger. On the basis of the concept, a GCUA finger with 2 joints is designed, which is realized by the coordination of screw-nut transmission mechanism, flexible drawstring constraint and pulley-belt under-actuated mechanism. Principle analyses of its grasping and the design optimization of the GCUA finger are given. An important problem of how to stably grasp an object which is easy to glide is discussed. The force analysis on gliding object in grasping process is introduced in detail. A GCUA finger with 3 joints is developed. Many experiments of grasping different objects by of the finger were carried out. The experimental results show that the GCUA finger can effectively realize functions of pre-bending and self-adaptive grasping, the grasping processes are stable. The GCUA finger excels under-actuated fingers in dexterity and gesture actions and it is easier to control and cheaper than dexterous hands, becomes the third kinds of finger. © 2010 Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering.},

abstract={The spatial arrangement of the semicircular canals and extraocular muscles of the eye has been of considerable interest, particularly to researchers working on adaptations of the vestibulo-ocular reflex. Here we offer the first, extensive comparative analysis of the spatial relationships between each extraocular muscle and the canal providing its primary excitatory stimulus. The sample consisted of 113 specimens, representing 51 extant mammalian species. Hypotheses tested included that variations in the spatial alignments are linked with differences of skull morphology and with differences of agility during locomotion. Internal morphologies were visualized with magnetic resonance imaging and were measured with landmark-based vectors and planes. Values for body mass and agility were taken from the existing literature. Data were investigated for trends and associations with standard bivariate and multivariate statistical methods as well as with phylogenetically adjusted bivariate methods. The findings clearly show that species differences in the alignment of each extraocular muscle relative to the canal providing its primary excitatory stimulus are closely associated with changes of orbit morphology. The results also indicate that the actions of the oblique muscles interchange with those of the superior and inferior recti muscles when comparing lateral-eyed (rabbit) with frontal-eyed species (cat). There was only weak evidence to support the notion that canal-muscle alignments differ significantly among species according to how agile they are. The results suggest that semicircular canal morphology is arranged primarily for detecting head movements and then secondarily, if at all, for diminishing the burden of transforming vestibulo-ocular reflex signals in the most agile species. © 2010 The Authors.

The IBM Quality Software Engineering (QSE) organization motivates and enables teams across IBM business units and geographies to adopt recommended software engineering practices. QSE has historically established communities and used well-known organizational change management principles to help teams adopt and use recommended practices. In 2008 and 2009, QSE discovered that blending well-known organizational change management principles with agile software development principles enables communities to more consistently deliver significant value to their members. QSE Communities use Scrum, which is an agile project management framework, to prioritize their work on the basis of the communities' needs, plan their work every two weeks and then deliver value at the end of every two-week Sprint (iteration), demonstrate results, and obtain feedback and continuously improve by reflecting and identifying improvement actions at the end of each Sprint.

abstract={As business and technology environments change atan unpre-cedented rate, software development agility to respond to changing user requirements has become increasingly critical for software development performance. Agile software development approaches, which emphasize sense-and-respond, self-organization, cross-functional teams, and continuous adaptation, have been adopted by an increasing number of organizations to improve their software development agility. However, the agile development literature is largely anee-dotal and prescriptive, lacking empirical evidence and theoretical foundation to support the principles and practices of agile development. Little research has empirically examined the software development agility construct in terms of its dimensions, determinants, and effects on software development performance. As a result, there is a lack of understanding about how organizations can effectively implement an agile development approach. Using an integrated research approach that combines quantitative and qualitative data analyses, this research opens the black box of agile development by empirically examining the relationships among two dimensions of software development agility (software team response extensiveness and software team response efficiency), two antecedents that can be controlled (team autonomy and team diversity), and three aspects of software development performance (on-time completion, on-budget completion, and software functionality). Our PLS results of survey responses of 399 software project managers suggest that the relationships among these variables are more complex than what has been perceived by the literature. The results suggest a tradeoff relationship between response extensiveness and response efficiency. These two agility dimensions impact software development performance differently: response efficiency positively affects all of on-time completion, on-budget completion, and software functionality, whereas response extensiveness positively affects only software functionality. The results also suggest that team autonomy has a positive effect on response efficiency and a negative effect on response extensiveness, and that team diversity has a positive effect on response extensiveness. We conducted 10 post hoc case studies to qualitatively crossvalidate our PLS results and provide rich, additional insights regarding the complex, dynamic interplays between autonomy, diversity, agility, and performance. The qualitative analysis also provides explanations for both supported and unsupported hypotheses. We discuss these qualitative analysis results and conclude with the theoretical and practical implications of our research findings for agile development approaches.},

abstract={Agile development delivers value quickly, using a series of short-term goals based on immediate priorities. Architecture grows value carefully, using a set of long-term objectives based on fundamental principles. The two seem at odds, but the architect can bring them together at four well-defined points in agile projects: during project initiation by setting architectural direction, through storyboarding by introducing specific architectural tasks, within sprints by close collaboration on challenging issues, and as working software gets delivered by performing direct inspection. This requires four critical skills: decomposing architectural work into iterative form, advocating the merits of architecture throughout development, tracking the architectural state of the project as it executes, and driving toward a broader enterprise architecture to which all agile projects contribute. When done effectively, this approach achieves a pragmatic balance between business and architectural priorities while delivering both with agility. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Agile development methods such as extreme programming (XP), SCRUM, Lean Software Development (Lean SD) and others have gained much popularity during the last years. Agile methodologies promise faster time-to-market, satisfied customers and high quality software. While these prospects are appealing, the suitability of agile practices to different domains and business contexts still remains unclear. In this article we investigate the applicability of agile principles in the context of market-driven software product development (MDPD), focusing on pre-project activities. This article presents results of a comparison between typical properties of agile methods to the needs of MDPD, as well as findings of a case study conducted at Ericsson, an early adopter of agile product development. The results show misalignment between the agile principles and needs of pre-project activities in market-driven development. This misalignment threatens to subtract from the positive aspects of agile development, but may be more importantly, threaten the overall product development by disabling effective product management.

abstract={Purpose: Agile methods have proven successful in increasing customer satisfaction and decreasing time and cost to market under uncertain conditions. Key characteristics of agile methods are lean, flexibility and highly iterative development with a strong emphasis on stakeholder involvement. Today construction firms in general and small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular are surviving in a drastic competitive environment in which they are facing more and more challenges. Additional innovation is needed in the construction sector, with increased participation from more competitive SMEs. The main purpose of this paper is to present a model to prioritize available management systems to help SMEs address the challenge of today's market competition more effectively. Design/methodology/approach: The research methodology used is that of interpretative case study and grounded theory based on a strong empirical foundation, on which new theoretical insight into knowledge management as an autonomous action is developed. The paper looks at ways by which SMEs are managed, based on the empirical data collected from 12 case studies. It presents the empirical findings drawn from the case studies. Finally, the adoption of agile methods is subjectively assessed as to its potential contribution for improving the business processes of small and medium construction firms. Findings: It is assessed that agile methods offers considerable potential for application in construction SMEs and that there are significant hurdles to its adoption in the actual phase. Should these be overcome, agile methods offers benefits well beyond any individual company. Practical implications: Construction firms need to be aware of the advantages of new management paradigms and practices. The analysis shows that SMEs in the construction sector have to internalize agile values into their business processes to reap the benefits of agile methods. It also reveals that existing practices show some kind of agile flavours. Originality/value: Agile principles and methods are explored, including: philosophy, values, practices and benefits. The management approaches used by construction SMEs are analyzed and discussed. The paper presents recommendations and insights for enhancing the performance and efficiency of SMEs by adopting agile values in their business processes. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Swordtails (Xiphophorus; Poeciliidae) have figured prominently in research on fish mating behaviours, sexual selection, and carcinogenesis, but their population structures and dispersal patterns have been relatively neglected. Using nine microsatellite loci, we estimated genetic differentiation in Xiphophorus helleri within and between adjacent streams in Belize. The genetic data were complemented by a tagging study of movement within one stream. In the absence of physical dispersal barriers (waterfalls), population structure followed an isolation by distance (IBD) pattern. Genetic differentiation (F ST up to 0.07) was significant between and within creeks, despite high dispersal in the latter as judged by the tagging data. Such heterogeneity apparently was a result of genetic drift in local demes, due to small population sizes and highly skewed paternity. The IBD pattern was interrupted by waterfalls, boosting FST above 0.30 between adjacent samples across these barriers. Overall, our results are helpful in understanding the interplay of evolutionary forces and population dynamics in a small fish living in a changeable habitat. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Task-based workflows describe a set of predefined tasks executed in a predefined sequence flow in which documents representing business objects are sent to activate tasks according to some business goal. The increasingly agile nature of business processes implies that neither the potential tasks nor their sequence flow can be defined a priori. In this context, documents may constitute the central abstraction in a business process execution while services are stateless entities. While business goals and associated business rules drive models and their executions, document content and its structure may additionally be used to determine how the document can be processed and how multiple processing tasks may be composed dynamically. This paper introduces a document-based workflow model that implements such agile business processes. The described approach relies on the use of a rule-based system as a means to capture diverse concerns such as business goals and associated rules within a uniform framework. To this end, we illustrate this approach with an electronic health record (EHR) application. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={In recent years, agile methods have become more popular in the software industry. Agile methods are a new approach compared to plan-driven approaches. One of the most important shifts in adopting an agile approach is the central focus given to people in the process. This is exemplified by the independence afforded to developers in the development work they do. This work investigates the opinions of practitioners about daily stand-up meetings in the agile methods and the role of developer in that. For our investigation we joined a yahoo group called "Extreme Programming". Our investigation suggests that although trust is an important factor in agile methods. But stand-ups are not the place to build trust. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract={The VENUS (http://venus.uvic.ca/) and NEPTUNE Canada (http://neptunecanada. ca/) cabled ocean observatories have been envisioned from their inception as underwater extensions of the Internet. Having sensors connected to a network opens up tremendous opportunities, from real-time access to sensor measurements to the interactive control of remote assets. Moreover, with a software system in control, data from all sensors can be managed, archived and made available to the wider community. Finally, a data management system can also offer features that are unique to centrally managed instrumentation: thanks to communication standards, autonomous event detection and reaction becomes a very powerful possibility. This talk will summarize the salient features of DMAS (Data Management and Archiving System) that have been implemented over the past four years as well as the planned features to be delivered soon. DMAS consists of two main components: The Data Acquisition Framework (DAF) takes care of the interaction with instruments in terms of control, monitoring as well as data acquisition and storage. The framework also contains operation control tools. The user interaction features include data search and retrieval, data distribution. Current developments in the Web 2.0 area will provide a complete research environment where users will have the ability to work and interact on-line with colleagues, process and visualize data, establish observation schedules and pre-program autonomous, event detection and reaction. We call this environment "Oceans 2.0". The architecture of DMAS is focused on limiting the amount of data loss and maximizing up time. It is a service oriented architecture, making use of some of the more advanced tools available. The code is written in Java and makes use of an Enterprise Service Bus and of the publish-and-subscribe paradigm. The paper also describes the management approaches that were adopted to build DMAS. Good code quality, the continuous support of VENUS and the need for flexibility in dealing with rapidly changing requirements were the drivers behind the adoption of in-house development, the Agile development methodology and the creation of three teams. The development team deals with requirement collection, analysis, design, coding and unit testing; the QA/QC team performs software tests and regression in a production-like environment. The systems/operations team focuses on the hardware and system software preparation and support, receives and installs new code releases after QA approval and monitors systems operations. We are vying to perform new code releases twice a month. The method has worked well during the four years of the system development phase and has allowed for a constant support of VENUS. DMAS will be completed well under budget. ©2009 IEEE.},

abstract={We introduce a new tool-ÆSOPUS: Accurate Equation of State and OPacity Utility Software-for computing the equation of state and the Rosseland mean (RM) opacities of matter in the ideal gas phase. Results are given as a function of one pair of state variables, (i.e. temperature T in the range 3.2 ≥ log(T) ≥ 4.5, and parameter R = ρ/(T/10 6 K) 3 in the range-8 ≥ log(R) ≥ 1), and arbitrary chemical mixture. The chemistry is presently solved for about 800 species, consisting of almost 300 atomic and 500 molecular species. The gas opacities account for many continuum and discrete sources, including atomic opacities, molecular absorption bands, and collision-induced absorption. Several tests made on ÆSOPUS have proved that the new opacity tool is accurate in the results, flexible in the management of the input prescriptions, and agile in terms of computational time requirement. Purpose of this work is to greatly expand the public availability of Rosseland mean opacity data in the low-temperature regime. We set up a web-interface (http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/aesopus) which enables the user to compute and shortly retrieve RM opacity tables according to his/her specific needs, allowing a full degree of freedom in specifying the chemical composition of the gas. As discussed in the paper, useful applications may regard, for instance, RM opacities of gas mixtures with i) scaled-solar abundances of metals, choosing among various solar mixture compilations available in the literature; ii) varying CNO abundances, suitable for evolutionary models of red and asymptotic giant branch stars and massive stars in the Wolf-Rayet stages; iii) various degrees of enhancement in α-elements, and C-N, O-Na, and Mg-Al abundance anti-correlations, necessary to properly describe the properties of stars in early-type galaxies and Galactic globular clusters; iv) zero-metal abundances appropriate for studies of gas opacity in primordial conditions. © 2009 ESO.},

abstract={Agile software development methods are quite popular nowadays and are being adopted at an increasing rate in the industry every year. However, these methods are still lacking usability awareness in their development lifecycle, and the integration of usability/User- Centered Design (UCD) into agile methods is not adequately addressed. This paper presents the preliminary results of a recently conducted online survey regarding the current state of the integration of agile methods and usability/UCD. A world wide response of 92 practitioners was received. The results show that the majority of practitioners perceive that the integration of agile methods with usability/UCD has added value to their adopted processes and to their teams; has resulted in the improvement of usability and quality of the product developed; and has increased the satisfaction of the end-users of the product developed. The top most used HCI techniques are low-fidelity prototyping, conceptual designs, observational studies of users, usability expert evaluations, field studies, personas, rapid iterative testing, and laboratory usability testing. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2009.},

There is therefore a strong tendency to use agile software development methodologies where applicable; however, the sheer number of existing agile methodologies and their variants hinders the selection of an appropriate agile methodology or method chunk. Methodology evaluation tools address this problem through providing detailed evaluations, yet no comprehensive evaluation framework is available for agile methodologies. We introduce the Comprehensive Evaluation Framework for Agile Methodologies (CEFAM) as an evaluation tool for project managers and method engineers. The hierarchical (and mostly quantitative) evaluation criterion set introduced in this evaluation framework enhances the usability of the framework and provides results that are precise enough to be useful for the selection, adaptation and construction of agile methodologies. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Agile software development has gained popularity due to its adaptability, simple design and working software practices. Agilists prefer to keep design simple by refactoring. Re-factoring is one of popular practice adopted by agile methods. Re-factoring in software development may be achieved in code as well as in database. Re-factoring is breaking the code or data without changing the behavioral aspects. Re-factoring improves the readability and understandability of code and database. This paper illustrates a case study to demonstrate quality improvement in design through re-factoring.},

abstract={Not only products but also product development get more and more complex. International teams at different locations spread over the globe have to elaborate adequate solutions in shorter project cycles. Market conditions are rapidly changing not only caused by increasing demands on individuality but also due to political, economic and ecological influences. In order to remain competitive, customer satisfaction is the key. A major hindrance in this context is the limited ability of customers to express or even comprehensively identify their own requirements. But also manufacturers often have a lack of knowledge concerning their customers or relevant target groups. The approach delineated in this contribution introduces a concept of adopting agile methods of the software community to engineering, which allows detecting aberrations from demands and requirements early in the development process. The aim is to iteratively build (virtual) prototypes that consider only the main and obvious requirements in the first step. After each iteration an evaluation discloses whether the realization has met the expectations or not and additional requirements can be taken into account for the next step. This minimizes the overall risk of developing unsatisfactory products.},

abstract={The business-critical chain lifecycle is an agile software development lifecycle that aims at aligning the software project deliverables to attain the business objectives based on business priorities. The traditional software development projects work on the assumption that all 'equal effort consumers' would be treated equally and worked upon. The agile methodology ensures that the delivery cycles are reduced thus introducing agility in the way business is supported by underlying technologies. The proposed lifecycle model introduces new variables pertaining to the business value generation each finished piece of code would produce. Hence the software project processes have to be modified to cater to it. Even the usual agile lifecycle testing strategies need to be modified to suit the proposed model. The test plans, test estimations, test resource management, quality control, regression plans and automation road map and plans have to be customized to cater to the new life cycle model. The secondary project management activities such as risk management, procurement management, etc also may to be modified with respect to the testing processes. My paper aims at using the critical chain principles and proposes a software lifecycle model that can cater to business priorities and aligning the testing processes not only to development cycles but also to the actual business value created. In this paper I would take a case study and compare and contrast when project uses the regular models and this new model. I would also provide guidelines to use this lifecycle model and modify regular project management activities to cater to the new model with emphasis on the testing processes. The paper would try to provide the ideal scenarios; in project teams, in consulting firms and in new customers and expectations; where such a model could provide high impact on the way consulting companies can do successful projects and creating more value to the customers. © 2009 IEEE.},

This does not refer to a methodology for developing software services or service-oriented architectures. Rather, it is a method for managing the process of software development in a service-oriented approach in which the actions performed by individuals and groups are modeled as "services" which can be choreographed and orchestrated. SOSD has been adopted informally by many organizations in various forms and it runs somewhat contrary to some of the recent trends toward agile development methodologies. Interestingly, it performs well in certain situations where agile methods tend to break down. In addition to describing the basics of SOSD and its theoretical underpinnings, we outline its benefits and potential shortcomings. As evidence, project data is provided from a Fortune 500 company which has gradually adopted SOSD over the last two years.},

abstract={In recent years a host of new agile software development methodologies have been introduced. These methodologies emphasize people over process, software over documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation and responding to change over following a plan. They are quite different from the traditional process oriented approaches. One major implication of these differences is the need for a less rigid and formal approach to project management. This paper describes leadership characteristics that are conducive to agile software development environments and maps these characteristics to Churchman's five modes of inquiry. With agile's focus on people over processes, it is critical to a project's success to have the right types of people "leading the charge". By mapping desirable characteristics of agile leaders to specific inquiry modes, the goal of this paper is to provide insight into the types of managers that are most likely to be successful in an agile environment.},

abstract={Structured System Analysis and Design (SSAD) is still considered one of the most straightforward systems approaches, despite both supporting arguments and criticisms. One philosophy in software engineering is to "document everything". However, the waterfall model within SSAD discourages frequent changing of requirements, which is a significant problem to designers. Compared with SSAD, Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE) with its modular structured solution allows individual components to be replaced easily at design time or run time if the requirements of the initial component (expressed via the interface) are met by the replacement component. After years of experience in developing and architecting reliable architectures for software-intensive distributed systems, the authors present a PAISE (Perspective-bridged Architecture with Interoperability, Substitutability, and Extensibility) model with the aim of automating systems perspective transitioning through a document-driven approach within SSAD. The authors stress important abilities of architecting application systems such as interoperability, substitutability, and extensibility in support of component-based software engineering. PAISE starts with a conceptual system that is rapidly prototyped for requirements, follows with a technical system that addresses the interior structure of the system, and results in an operational system for business process. In combination with re-ADA (an architectural description language as well as its runtime foundation), PAISE/re-ADA can not only promote a document-driven approach with SSAD, but also automate system perspective transitioning with CBSE.

abstract={Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) are composed of frequency-agile radio devices that allow licensed (primary) and unlicensed (secondary) users to coexist, where secondary users opportunistically access channels without interfering with the operation ofprimary ones. From the perspective ofsecondary users, spectrum availability is a time varying network resource over which multi-hop end-to-end connections must be maintained. In this work, a theoretical outlook on the problem of routing secondary user flows in a CRN is provided. The investigation aims to characterize optimal sequences ofroutes over which a secondary flow is maintained. The optimality is defined according to a novel metric that considers the maintenance cost ofa route as channels and/or links must be switched due to the primary user activity. Different from the traditional notion of route stability, the proposed approach considers subsequent path selections, as well. The problem is formulated as an integer programming optimization model and shown to be of polynomial time complexity in case of full knowledge of primary user activity. Properties of the problem are also formally introduced and leveraged to design a heuristic algorithm to solve the minimum maintenance cost routing problem when information on primary user activity is not complete. Numerical results are presented to assess the optimality gap of the heuristic routing algorithm. ©2009 IEEE.},

We introduce the concept of implementation scenario: a particular subset of requirement - even non-functional - that greatly improves risk management and overall architecture stabilization efficiency, and also is one of the key aspects for agile-prescriptive integration. The method also proposes a built-in support to software development outsourcing, which consists of a process-centered interface between customer and provider based on activity assignment, artifact custody and the method design itself. The method has been informally tested on small and medium size projects so far. Tests have shown significant results that are presented and discussed.},

abstract={Standard process models like RUP or the German V-Modell XT are developed to be used in an organizational environment. Yet introducing such a process model into an organization is no simple task. It is usually accompanied by either reorganizing internal processes to comply with a standard process model or by adaptation of the process model to organizational structures. The latter is an approach that can often be found in practice and is subject to this paper. The paper describes a generalization of the process model architecture of the V-Modell XT 1.3. Compared to the previous version 1.2.1.1, its metamodel has completely been revised with respect to a new adaptation concept. We will see how this concept allows the implementation of a so called process line.

abstract={The U.S. National Science Foundation supported Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Sciences (CUAHSI) Hydrologic Information System (HIS) project includes extensive development of data storage and delivery tools and standards including WaterML (a language for sharing hydrologic data sets via web services), and HIS Server (a software tool set for delivering WaterML from a server). These and other CUASHI HIS tools have been under development and deployment for several years and together present a relatively complete software "stack", to support the consistent storage and delivery of hydrologic and other environmental observation data. This paper describes the development of a new HIS software tool called "HIS Desktop" and the development of an online open source software development community to update and maintain the software. HIS Desktop was envisioned as a local (i.e. not server-based) client side software tool that ultimately will run on multiple operating systems and will provide a highly usable level of access to HIS Services. The software will provide several capabilities including data query, map-based visualization, data download, local data maintenance, editing, graphing, data export to selected model-specific data formats, linkage with integrated modeling systems such as OpenMI, and ultimately upload to the HIS server from the local desktop software. As the software is presently in the early stages of development, this paper focuses on design approach and paradigm and is presented to encourage participation in the open development community. Indeed, recognizing the value of community based code development as a means of ensuring end-user adoption, this project has adopted an "iterative" or "spiral" software development approach where 1) the general project requirements and hard boundary conditions are specified at the outset; 2) an initial brief functionality requirements list is developed; 3) the initial limited system is produced primarily by the core funded developer team, but with voluntary external programmer support as it becomes available; 4) testing and bug fixes by the developer team; 5) deployment of an installation package for end-users; 6) collection of bug notices and feature requests from end-users; 7) identification of specific bugs and features to be addressed in a new release; 8) addition of these features by the developer team, etc. This development approach is the most common approach used by open source projects because of its flexible and dynamic nature. This model is well suited to a community project where it is difficult (and often not useful) to fully-specify the functionality set required for a software release (i.e. as in the "waterfall" development approach), but rather it is desirable to maintain an open structure that can easily be extended through the development of third party plug-ins to support as-yet unknown functions and capabilities, as well as a clear policy on how code is moved into the core system, and how external developers are included in the developer team.},

abstract={The notion of software as a service promises agile, flexible and low maintenance system development through a dynamic runtime architecture that allows third-party functionality and capability to be added on demand. There is growing research interest in how service-orientation can be adopted a means for enhancing agility and flexibility in product line engineering. However, integrating service-orientation in product line engineering poses a number of challenges. These include difficulty in identifying services, ensuring services reflect user needs, and determining configurations of services that are relevant in different user contexts. This paper describes an approach for service-oriented product line development that integrates feature-oriented engineering with a self-managing consumer-centred negotiation process to address these challenges. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an emerging architectural style for the development of interoperable, agile, large scale and distributed software systems. Such systems are based mainly on services as core building blocks which may interact with several types of service clients. Hence, the central problem is how to deal with the challenge of adaptability of such services. The present paper proposes a Model-Driven engineering approach for adaptable service oriented systems. The proposed MDD approach consists of (1) a Unified Modeling Language (UML) profile to graphically model adaptable service oriented systems regardless of standards and implementation platforms. The key element of the proposed profile is the multiview service defined as a first class modeling entity that allows the representation of the needs and requirements of users by separating their concerns early in the development lifecycle of service oriented systems (2) an MDD tool that accepts a UML model defined with the proposed profile and transforms it to Java code which constitutes the implementation of each service according to the J2EE platform. ©2009 IEEE.},

A conceptual model based on these factors is proposed to study mindful or mindless behaviours of software team members in (a) the firm-specific postmortems of projects incorporating traditional software development methods and (b) the project reviews on the adoption and use of an Agile approach to software development, which was introduced to address problems with the traditional approach to software development. The setting for the project post-mortems is a large US multinational telecommunications manufacturer based in Ireland. One significant factor that leads to mindless adoption behaviours, and which was identified by this study, is the Abilene Paradox. The findings of this paper illustrate how ineffective management of agreement (as opposed to disagreement) contributes to the existence of this paradox, the consequence of which affects the mindfulness of an adoption and review processes. © 2009 Lavoisier, Paris.},

abstract={Landscape genetics holds promise for the forecasting of spatial patterns of genetic diversity based on key environmental features. Yet, the degree to which inferences based on single species can be extended to whole communities is not fully understood. We used a pristine and spatially structured community of three landlocked salmonids (Salvelinus fontinalis, Salmo salar, and Salvelinus alpinus) from Gros Morne National Park (Newfoundland, Canada) to test several predictions on the interacting effects of landscape and life history variation on genetic diversity, neutral divergence, and gene flow (m, migration rate). Landscape factors consistently influenced multispecies genetic patterns: (i) waterfalls created strong dichotomies in genetic diversity and divergence between populations above and below them in all three salmonids; (ii) contemporary m decreased with waterway distance in all three species, while neutral genetic divergence (θ) increased with waterway distance, albeit in only two taxa; (iii) river flow generally produced downstream-biased m between populations when waterfalls separated these, but not otherwise. In contrast, we expected differential life history to result in a hierarchy of neutral divergence (S. salar > S. fontinalis > S. alpinus) based on disparities in dispersal abilities and population size from previous mark-recapture studies. Such hierarchy additionally matched varying degrees of spatial genetic structure among species revealed through individual-based analyses. We conclude that, whereas key landscape attributes hold power to predict multispecies genetic patterns in equivalent communities, they are likely to interact with species-specific life history attributes such as dispersal, demography, and ecology, which will in turn affect holistic conservation strategies. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

A number of VBEs have been formed world-wide during the last decade, mostly among organizations located in a common region, with common business culture, and primarily focus on specific lines of activities. This paper however addresses the 2nd generation VBEs that are not bound to geographical regions or specific activities. These VBEs shall play an active role in the society/market as competitive entities, and need to effectively support agile configuration and establishment of dynamic VOs. Furthermore, the 2nd generation VBEs require enabling ICT infrastructure and tools, to facilitate their daily management activities as well as supporting the collaboration among their member organizations.

abstract={Case Description: The main subject of this case is B2B e-commerce in the Middle East. Secondary issues examined are: strategic factors facing the company examined in the case study; the B2B business model; privacy and security issues of e-commerce; and new business strategies for B2B. This case has a difficulty level of four and is best utilized in a senior level Strategic Management/E-Marketing course. Depending upon the depth of analysis, the case can be taught in three to six hours and requires a preparation time of three to six hours. Case Synopsis: The introduction of Internet use and the resulting growth in e-commerce has changed the service industry in the 21st century. These factors have led to changes in online transactions and have introduced new, Internet-only services companies, forcing traditional service institutions to quickly develop and implement an e-commerce strategy. The current case analyzes strategic issues surrounding e-business at Bewari, a B2B company established in June 2000 that allows companies in the Arabian Gulf region to buy and sell goods and services online. Bewari is a hypothetical company. At the request of the real company's management, its name is kept confidential since Bewari did not want to disclose its operations to its competitors. This case study is chosen since the Arabian Gulf region is unique in terms of culture, tradition, business practices, human and organizational values compared to those in developed economies. Most of the economies in the region are oil-rich. Business development practices in one economy in a particular sector are rapidly imitated by businesses in the neighboring economies in the region. The economies in the region form a major trade bloc of major importance to neighboring European and Asian economies. Bewari has chosen to create and maintain the highest standard B2B customer service and trading facilities in the Middle East. The case shows that Bewari: is an ideal partner for helping companies reach new markets in real time is agile enough to respond to fast changing market opportunities provides innovative online B2B services, enabling B2B firms to extend their reach and enhance their competitive standing, and integrates supply chain. Nevertheless, growing pains have ensued. From its inception, Bewari has given access to the resources and culture thought necessary to allow it to succeed. While Bewari was given the right resources and freedom to succeed, it was asked to do so within an organization incapable of producing the desired product. Bewari faces pressure from its stakeholders to improve performance and maximize synergies from recent alliances. In addition, decisions and options regarding Bewari must be taken into consideration as part of Bewari's overall strategy. © 2009 by the DreamCatchers Group.},

abstract={For many organizations the transition to agile methods is problematic due to history of bureaucratization and subsequent extensive specialization of knowledge among people. Specialist knowledge inhibits self-organization and role interchangeability which are key elements of agile development. Knowing that bureaucracies are hard to counteract once established, how can development of general knowledge in software organizations be improved? Job rotation is a well-known practice often used to improve general knowledge. The reported action research evaluated job rotation among developers in customer support. The findings suggest that general knowledge is considered interesting and valuable among the participants. However, the findings also show that general knowledge acquisition can be found irrelevant and therefore counter-efficient for day-to-day work among participants if the perceived applicability to own projects is too low. Therefore, using job rotation to improve general knowledge requires careful considerations. Implications for research and practice are discussed.},

Because the investigators are working in a research environment where the results produced at intermediate stages cause the requirements to continually change, an agile software development methodology was deemed most appropriate. Although the research team applied several agile practices, the paper emphasizes their experiences when performing test-first or test-driven development (TDD). When applying test-first development, the programmer writes test cases in the designated programming language prior to composing functional code. The objective during code implementation is to write code to pass a particular test case. Thus, the activities of specifying test cases, coding, and testing comprise an iterative process. As a part of this work, the authors compare test-driven development to the more traditional approaches of testing. ©2009 ACM.},

abstract={Projects combining agile methods with CMMI combine adaptability with predictability to better serve large customer needs. The introduction of Scrum at Systematic, a CMMI Level 5 company, doubled productivity and cut defects by 40% compared to waterfall projects in 2006 by focusing on early testing and time to fix builds. Systematic institutionalized Scrum across all projects and used data driven tools like story process efficiency to surface Product Backlog impediments. This allowed them to systematically develop a strategy for a second doubling in productivity. Two teams have achieved a sustainable quadrupling of productivity compared to waterfall projects. We discuss here the strategy to bring the entire company to that level. Our experiences shows that Scrum and CMMI together bring a more powerful combination of adaptability and predictability than either one alone and suggest how other companies can combine them to achieve Toyota level performance - 4 times the productivity and 12 times the quality of waterfall teams.},

abstract={In 2008, our organization successfully implemented an agile software development approach (Scrum) across the Application Development department after piloting Scrum in 2007 with a few projects. In just four months, our department consisting of over 200 contractors and 70 full time employees transitioned from a traditional waterfallstyle approach (RUP) to Scrum. Less then 2 months later, we were running 40 development projects that were time boxed to three months. In the previous year, we had 20 active projects with duration of 9 to 18 months. After a year of introducing Agile, members of our organization were well aware of what Scrum was, but growing weary of training. There was a clear need to create excitement around the adoption and scaling of Scrum within the application development group. This led us to develop what we called 'The Amazing Team Race.' This experience report is about how an agile transition team used a team-based approach for creating excitement while scaling Scrum in a globally distributed organization.},

abstract={The Support 2.0 Team at our IT organization has recently completed Phase 1 of the Support 2.0 project. Phase 1 was a four month endeavor with a primary focus of collecting data to understand why support was so costly and identify the root cause for each support request. The team strongly believed that this initial phase would be critical to making significant impacts to the quality and supportability of applications. This experience report describes the challenge for the Support 2.0 Team and shares the successful adoption of agile practices in redefining the support organization. In the spirit of the agile transition to software development one year prior, our IT organization decided to rethink the approach to application support. By embracing agile principles and utilizing agile concepts, such as a cross-functional team, a team collaboration approach with frequent reviews to inspect and adapt as needed, etc, the business was able to reap immediate benefits. It was a challenging journey for the team, where the mix of onshore/offshore support engineers and an integrated client / vendor relationship within an agile team and focused framework helped to transform the support organization from an operational cost center to a value added thought partner. This resulted in a significantly improved culture and effectiveness of the support organization. This unique organization of an agile, cross-functional and team-based approach to handle support requests improved the customer experience, reduced support costs, and ultimately provided greater opportunity for the business to fund new development efforts.},

abstract={By late 2004, Scrum had been chosen independently as a development process by several teams at Amazon.com. From then until 2009, Scrum spread to a large portion of the software development teams at Amazon. This widespread adoption occurred in part due to the actions of a single individual and in part due to the natural match between Scrum's characteristics and the culture prevalent at Amazon.com. Widespread use of small, independent teams and a general empowerment at the team level made Scrum a smaller step to take for development teams at Amazon than it would be at many companies of equal or greater size. The success of Scrum at Amazon shows how important the prevailing culture of the company can be in terms of supporting an Agile transformation. These lessons are relevant to Scrum transformations being undertaken at many companies today.},

Menlo found that many of the agile engineering practices, when performed well, form the basis for effective knowledge transfer.

abstract={In 2004, SEP tried adopting Agile practices. However, Agile failed to have the desired lasting impact across the entire organization. Things changed in 2007, when SEP implemented a kanban system for the first time. Kanban created an effective means for institutionalization of Lean by providing a unique method of discovering and learning practices and principles. Upon examining multiple teams using kanban systems it was apparent that teams followed similar patterns of adoption and learning. They appeared to follow the Dreyfus Model for Skill Acquisition.},

abstract={Based on information theoretic tools, a new spectrum sensing method is proposed in this paper to detect vacant sub-bands in the radio spectrum 1. Specifically, based on the subspace analysis of the received signal, we present a new method to detect the signal presence in a blind way. We have shown that the analysis of signal dimension can assist blind spectrum sensing procedure. Indeed, we have shown that the slope change, from positive to negative trend, of the signal space dimension curve is representative of the transition from a vacant band to an occupied band (and vice versa). In fact, the number of significant eigenvalues is determined by the value that minimizes the Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and is directly related to the presence/absance of data in the signal. The validation of this new method is based on experimental measurements captured by Eurécom RF Agile Platform operating from 200 MHz to 7.5 GHz. Simulations show good results in terms of spectrum holes detection. ©2009 IEEE.},

Evolutionary software development represents an alternative to plan-driven development in order to tackle today's turbulent environments. In agile development, a type of evolutionary development, the product owner (P.O.) who is the customer representative- real accountable role- is ill-equipped to identify and prioritize the stakeholders' most success-critical expectations and potential sources of business value. Furthermore, the tools he can use have their own scalability issues that question their underlying principles. Moreover, without a substantial involvement to take into account all stakeholders, software providers are more likely acting as commodity-utility providers than real business partners. In today's business context, there is a clear need for a value-driven development which embraces changes along with higher visibility and understanding of business transformations.

abstract={In this paper, we focus on challenges of supporting a decision support system (DSS) based on a hybrid approach (i.e. a federation system with data placement) for agile business intelligence applications. A DSS needs to be designed to handle a workload of potentially complex queries for important decision-making processes. The response time requirement (and a realistic goal) for such a DSS is near real time.The users of a DSS care about not only the response time but also the time stamp of the business operation report since both of them introduce uncertainty and risks to business decision-making. In our proposed DSS, each report is assigned with a business value; denoting its importance to business decision-making. An Information Value (IV) is a business value of a report discounted by time to reflex the uncertainty and risks associated with the computational latency and synchronization latency. We propose a novel Information Value-driven Query Processing (IVQP) framework specific for near real time DSS applications. The framework enables dynamic query plan selection by taking into account of information value and adaptation for online-arrival ad hoc queries. The framework works with single query as well as a workload of queries. The experimental results based on synthetic data and TPC-H show the effectiveness of our approach in achieving optimal information values for the workloads. © 2009 IEEE.},

This is designed according to a flexible architecture that enables agile evolution of specification formalisms and target artifacts employed along the development process. © 2009 IEEE.},

Self-management emerged as the key challenge in all projects. In the transformation from traditional command-and-control management to collaborative self-managing teams, the main challenges were the absence of redundancy and conflict between team- and individual-level autonomy. Our findings are based primarily on qualitative analysis of interviews and observations with developers and product managers. These findings can provide important insight to companies considering self-managing teams and agile development practices. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={The Alaska Simulator is an interactive software tool developed at the University of Innsbruck which allows people to test, analyze and improve their own planning behavior. In addition, the Alaska Simulator can be used for studying research questions in the context of business process management and other related fields. Thereby, the Alaska Simulator uses a journey as a metaphor for business processes. In the context of business process management the simulator can be used to compare traditional rather plan-driven methods for planning and executing a business process with more agile approaches supporting different decision deferral patterns. Instead of pre-planning everything in advance decision deferral patterns allow interleaving process modeling and execution and provide mechanisms for effectively dealing with uncertainty. The biggest challenge thereby is to find the right balance between pre-planning activities and keeping options open. The Alaska Simulator allows to explore how much planning is needed under different circumstances. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={We present the first catalog of high-confidence-ray sources detected by the AGILE satellite during observations performed from July 9, 2007 to June 30, 2008. Cataloged sources were detected by merging all the available data over the entire time period. AGILE, launched in April 2007, is an ASI mission devoted to-ray observations in the 30 MeV-50 GeV energy range, with simultaneous X-ray imaging capability in the 18-60 keV band. This catalog is based on Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) data for energies greater than 100 MeV. For the first AGILE catalog, we adopted a conservative analysis, with a high-quality event filter optimized to select-ray events within the central zone of the instrument field of view (radius of 40). This is a significance-limited (4) catalog, and it is not a complete flux-limited sample due to the non-uniform first-year AGILE sky coverage. The catalog includes 47 sources, 21 of which are associated with confirmed or candidate pulsars, 13 with blazars (7 FSRQ, 4 BL Lacs, 2 unknown type), 2 with HMXRBs, 2 with SNRs, 1 with a colliding-wind binary system, and 8 with unidentified sources. © ESO 2009.},

abstract={Unit testing plays a major role in the software development process. What started as an ad hoc approach is becoming a common practice among developers. It enables the immediate detection of bugs introduced into a unit whenever code changes occur. Hence, unit tests provide a safety net of regression tests and validation tests which encourage developers to refactor existing code with greater confidence. One of the major corner stones of the agile development approach is unit testing. Agile methods require all software classes to have unit tests that can be executed by an automated unit-testing framework. However, not all software systems have unit tests. When changes to such software are needed, writing unit tests from scratch, which is hard and tedious, might not be cost effective. In this paper we propose a technique which automatically generates unit tests for software that does not have such tests. We have implemented GenUTest, a prototype tool which captures and logs interobject interactions occurring during the execution of Java programs, using the aspect-oriented language AspectJ. These interactions are used to generate JUnit tests. They also serve in generating mock aspects - mock object-like entities, which enable testing units in isolation. The generated JUnit tests and mock aspects are independent of the tool, and can be used by developers to perform unit tests on the software. Comprehensiveness of the unit tests depends on the software execution. We applied GenUTest to several open source projects such as NanoXML and JODE. We present the results, explain the limitations of the tool, and point out direction to future work to improve the code coverage provided by GenUTest and its scalability. © Springer-Verlag 2009.},

In this paper, we advance the state-of-the-art of the research in this area by conducting a survey-based ex-post-facto study for identifying factors from the perspective of the ASD practitioners that will influence the success of projects that adopt ASD practices. In this paper, we describe a hypothetical success factors framework we developed to address our research question, the hypotheses we conjectured, the research methodology, the data analysis techniques we used to validate the hypotheses, and the results we obtained from data analysis. The study was conducted using an unprecedentedly large-scale survey-based methodology, consisting of respondents who practice ASD and who had experience practicing plan-driven software development in the past. The study indicates that nine of the 14 hypothesized factors have statistically significant relationship with "Success". The important success factors that were found are: customer satisfaction, customer collaboration, customer commitment, decision time, corporate culture, control, personal characteristics, societal culture, and training and learning. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

However SPI strategies based on CMMI-DEV require heavy software development processes and large investments in terms of cost and time that medium/small companies do not deal with. The so-called light software development processes, such as Agile Software Development (ASD), deal with these challenges. ASD welcomes changing requirements and stresses the importance of adaptive planning, simplicity and continuous delivery of valuable software by short time-framed iterations. ASD is becoming convenient in a more and more global, and changing software market. It would be greatly useful to be able to introduce agile methods such as Scrum in compliance with CMMI process model. This paper intends to increase the understanding of the relationship between ASD and CMMI-DEV reporting empirical results that confirm theoretical comparisons between ASD practices and CMMI level2. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={A number of recent studies reported on the success of applying agile methods in scientific software development projects. These studies found that agile methods are well suited to the exploratory, iterative, and collaborative nature of scientific inquiry. However, these findings might not be applicable in all situations pertaining to scientific software development projects. In addition, they only constitute a subset of the important factors while deciding which development methods and practices should be adopted. Therefore, it becomes important to conduct further research before making recommendations regarding the adoption of certain development methods and practices in this domain. In this progress report, we discuss our on-going research that will empirically study the characteristics of various scientific software development projects according to a model suggested by Boehm and Turner. We plan to conduct interviews and collect data from various scientific software development projects in the Baltimore-Washington area. We expect that our qualitative results will increase our understanding of the characteristics in those projects favoring plan-driven approaches or agile methods, and the needs and conditions associated with those characteristics. Our research provides guidance to scientific software developers by enhancing their capacity to evaluate and understand their own project characteristics and select effective software practices. As a long-term benefit in the same direction, our qualitative results will generate a set of hypotheses that can be tested in different project environments to better understand and categorize scientific software development projects. Consequently, in the future, more generalizable and actionable recommendations can be made for scientific software development projects. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={The assumptions that underlie software development often go unrecorded and form part of the implicit rationale on which design and implementation decisions are based. These assumptions can fail at any time, with serious consequences. This paper presents a lightweight approach to assumption management (AM) designed to suit agile development. Assumptions were monitored for three months within a small agile team. Two key indicators were proposed for measuring AM success but only one was detected in the research results. A number of strong correlations were found between properties of assumptions. Data collection largely depended on the subjective judgements of the first author, but they were validated with some success by his colleagues. In some ways, assumption management was found to complement agile development. However, AM was not fully integrated into the team's development process, due to difficulty in adopting an 'assumption-aware' way of thinking. Suggestions are offered on how this transition may be eased, and on how others might wish to build on this research. © 2009 IEEE.},

In this paper we apply a full lifecycle governance model to agile projects, focused on the iteration level. The concept is demonstrated via a case study of a large-scale, enterprise-critical software project that implemented agile practices. We analyze three governance events, including the metrics that triggered the event, the decisions taken and the follow-up to ensure resolution. We conclude that governance iterations can be naturally unified with agile development iterations, resulting in a lean governance mechanism that identifies and resolves issues in an effective and timely manner. © 2009 IEEE.},

The governance roles, responsibilities and deliverables seemed to be in place on different organizational levels. However, closer inspection revealed challenges in the practical implementation. There were too many roles and hierarchy levels with information consistency problems in between. Prioritization of the high-level goals was unclear and made it difficult to plan and organize development work based on business value. The trace from high-level goals to more detailed plans was easily corrupted due to poor planning practices. Progress monitoring of daily work was poorly done and not linked to high-level plans. Consequently, the required feedback loops were inadequate, making it impossible for management to take corrective actions in time. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={The importance of good software testing is often reported. Traditionally, acceptance testing is the last stage of the testing process before release to the customer. Unfortunately, it is not always appropriate to wait so long for customer feedback. Emerging agile methods recognise this and promote close interaction between the customer and developers for early acceptance testing, often before implementation commences. Indeed, Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) is a process that uses customer interaction to define tests and tool support to automate and execute these. However, with existing tools, tests are usually written from new descriptions or rewritten from existing documentation. Here, the challenge is to allow developers and customers to annotate existing documentation and automatically generate acceptance tests without rewrites or new descriptions. This paper introduces the related ideas and describes a particular experiment that assesses the value of using annotated text to create acceptance tests.},

We analyzed 191 samples from 11 populations and identified 78 haplotypes. The phylogenetic analyses and analysis of molecular variance all supported the same conclusions of two well-differentiated east-west phylogroups, separated by the Tsangpo Great Gorge. The split between the two clades accounted for 58% of the genetic variance observed among the examined samples. Waterfalls as effective barriers played an important role in shaping the phylogeographical structure of this species. Analyses of migration rates revealed that upstream dispersal was limited crossing waterfalls. Our study revealed substantial spatial and temporal variation in the influence of landscape features on contemporary patterns of genetic structure in S. o'connori. Interglacial range expansions clearly left their mark on contemporary populations above the Tsangpo Great Gorge. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

abstract={Motivated by its success as a therapeutic treatment in other neurological disorders, most notably Parkinson's disease, Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is currently being trialled in a number of patients with drug unresponsive epilepsies. However, the mechanisms by which DBS interferes with neuronal activity linked to the disorder are not well understood. Furthermore, there is a need to identify optimized values of parameters (for example in amplitude/frequency space) of the stimulation protocol with which one aims to achieve the desired outcome. In this paper we characterise the system response to stimulation, to gain an understanding of the role different brain regions play in generating the output observed in EEG. We perform a number of experiments in healthy rats, where the ventral-lateral thalamic nucleus is stimulated using a train of square-waves with different frequency and amplitudes. The response to stimulation in the motor cortex is recorded and the drive-response relationship over frequency/amplitude space is considered. Subsequently, we compare the experimental data with simulations of a mean-field model, finding good agreement between the output of the model and the experimental data - both in the time and frequency domains - when considering a transition to oscillatory activity in the cortex as the frequency of stimulation is increased. Overall, our study suggests that mean-field models can appropriately characterise the stimulus-response relationship of DBS in healthy animals. In this way, it constitutes a first step towards the goal of developing a closed-loop feedback control protocol for suppressing epileptic activity, by adaptively adjusting the stimulation protocol in response to EEG activity. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This paper addresses the foundations of the transform and its application to a calculational approach to extended static checking (ESC) in the context of abstract modeling. In particular, a calculus is given whose rules help in breaking the complexity of the proof obligations involved in static checking arguments. The close connection between such calculus and that of weakest pre-conditions makes it possible to use the latter in ESC proof obligation discharge, where pointfree notation is again used, this time to calculate with invariant properties to be maintained. A connection with the "everything is a relation" lemma of Alloy is established, showing how close to each other the pointfree and Alloy notations are. The main advantage of this connection is that of complementing pen-and-paper pointfree calculations with model checking support wherever validating sizable abstract models. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Agile development methods have gained momentum in the last few years and, as a consequence, test-driven development has become more prevalent in practice. However, test cases are not sufficient for producing dependable software and we rather advocate approaches that emphasize the use of assertions or contracts over that of test cases. Yet, writing self-checks in code has been shown to be difficult and is itself prone to errors. A standard technique to specify runtime properties is design-by-contract (DbC). But how can one test if the contracts themselves are sensible and sufficient? We propose a measure to quantify the goodness of contracts (or assertions in a broader sense). We introduce meta-mutations at the source code level to simulate common programmer errors that the self-checks are supposed to detect. We then use random mutation testing to determine a lower and upper bound on the detectable mutations and compare these bounds with the number of mutants detected by the contracts. Contracts are considered "good" if they detect a certain percentage of the detectable mutations.We have evaluated our tools on Java classes with contracts specified using the Java Modeling Language (JML). We have additionally tested the contract quality of 19 implementations, written independently by students, based on the same specification. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Recent developments in communications and RF technology have enabled system concept formulations and designs for low-cost radar systems using state-of-the-art software radio modules. One of the major benefits of using these RF communications products is the potential for generating frequency-agile waveforms that are re-programmable in real-time and potentially adapt to a scattering environment. In addition, recent simulation results [1] indicate that this type of system enables the development and implementation of multi-function RF systems that yield good performance within embedded shared-spectrum environments. This paper investigates the design and implementation of software radar systems via implementation of commercially available software radio modules. Specifically, the potential for developing alternative multi-tone radar systems that provide significant levels of information with respect to embedded indoor scattering environments is discussed. This approach is developed via the transform domain waveform synthesis/design and implementation of OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Domain Multiplexing) waveforms and shows good potential for the future development of cooperative multi-function RF systems. © 2009 SPIE.},

abstract={Adaptation to novel habitats and phenotypic plasticity can be counteracting forces in evolution, but both are key characteristics of the life history of steelhead/rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Anadromous steelhead reproduce in freshwater river systems and small coastal streams but grow and mature in the ocean. Resident rainbow trout, either sympatric with steelhead or isolated above barrier dams or waterfalls, represent an alternative life-history form that lives entirely in freshwater. We analyzed population genetic data from 1486 anadromous and resident O. mykiss from a small stream in coastal California with multiple barrier waterfalls. Based on data from 18 highly variable microsatellite loci (He = 0.68), we conclude that the resident population above one barrier, Big Creek Falls, is the result of a recent anthropogenic introduction from the anadromous population of O. mykiss below the falls. Furthermore, fish from this above-barrier population occasionally descend over the falls and have established a genetically differentiated below-barrier subpopulation at the base of the falls, which appears to remain reproductively isolated from their now-sympatric anadromous ancestors. These results support a hypothesis of rapid evolution of a purely resident life history in the above-barrier population in response to strong selection against downstream movement. © 2009 Published by Oxford University Press.},

abstract={Despite the popularity of agile methods in software development and increasing adoption by organizations there is debate about what agility is and how it is achieved. The debate suffers from a lack of understanding of agile concepts and how agile software development is practiced. This paper develops a framework for the organization of agile software development that identifies enablers and inhibitors of agility and the emergent capabilities of agile teams. The work is grounded in complex adaptive systems (CAS) and draws on three principles of coevolving systems: match coevolutionary change rate, maximize self-organizing, and synchronize exploitation and exploration. These principles are used to study the processes of two software development teams, one a team using eXtreme Programming (XP) and the other a team using a more traditional, waterfallbased development cycle. From the cases a framework for the organization of agile software development is developed. Time pacing, self-management with discipline and routinization of exploration are among the agile enablers found in the cases studies while event pacing, centralized management, and lack of resources allocated to exploration are found to be inhibitors to agility. Emergent capabilities of agile teams that are identified from the research include coevolution of business value, sustainable working with rhythm, sharing and team learning, and collective mindfulness. © 2009 INFORMS.},

abstract={In recent years, flexibility has emerged as a divisive issue in discussions about the appropriate design of proIcesses for making software. Partisans in both research and practice argue for and against plan-based (allegedly inflexible) and agile (allegedly too flexible) approaches. The stakes in this debate are high; questions raised about plan-based approaches undermine longstanding claims that those approaches, when realized, represent maturity of practice. In this commentary, we call for research programs that will move beyond partisan disagreement to a more nuanced discussion, one that takes into account both benefits and costs of flexibility. Key to such programs will be the development of a robust contingency framework for deciding when (in what conditions) plan-based and agile methods should be used. We develop a basic contingency framework in this paper, one that models the benefit/cost economics described in narratives about the transition from craft to industrial production of physical products. We use this framework to demonstrate the power of even a simple model to help us accomplish three objectives: (1) to refocus discussions about the appropriate design of software development processes, concentrating on when to use particular approaches and how they might be usefully combined; (2) to suggest and guide a trajectory of research that can support and enrich this discussion; and (3) to suggest a technology-based explanation for the emergence of agile development at this point in history. Although we are not the first to argue in favor of a contingency perspective, we show that there remain many opportunities for information systems (IS) research to have a major impact on practice in this area. © 2009 INFORMS.},

abstract={Computer industry workforce skills required continue to change rapidly. Newer computer technologies are introduced continually while existing ones become obsolete at a faster pace. It is a major challenge to evolve a flexible curriculum that can adapt to those rapid and substantial changes and that new graduates may be taught with. For example, when the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) released the Computer Curriculum in 1991, networking was not seen as a major topic area. Networking was not a mass-market phenomenon then, and the World Wide Web was little more than an idea in the minds of its creators. Today, networking and the web have changed the way we do business. Other professional organizations, in addition to ACM, such as the Institution of Electrical & Electronics Engineering (IEEE), and the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) are also at the forefront of addressing this challenge. They rapidly and continuously strive to provide the necessary directions in curriculum content and pedagogy. The current "Language First" CSE curriculum globally followed has stood the ground for close to five decades; but it has many inherent flaws. Some among them include emphasis on language and syntax rather than design methodology and problem solving. We put forth a pedagogy that is flexible, practical, and is based on the "Middle-Out Approach" which is a combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches; typically one integrates these two at an intermediate architect's level in an attempt to optimize a system. We, however, do not address these optimization and integration issues as part of our curriculum, because of time limitation. They can be undertaken as part of a Master's program. We categorize our undergraduate curriculum into 4 core categories namely, software, hardware, human-computer interaction and networking. Further each category curriculum is divided into 4 levels: (1) Level 1 (basic/system level) courses broadly include Software Engineering, SOC (System on a Chip) overview, Principles of User Interface Design, and Internet technology; (2) Level 2 (intermediate/component level) courses include Object Oriented Analysis & Design (OOAD), System Level Design, Operating Systems (OS), and Computer Networking; (3) Level 3 (higher/expanded level) courses could include Aspect Oriented/Extreme Programming, Computer Architecture, Modern Computer Design, OS Design, Grid Computing etc; and (4) Level 4 (detailed/micro level) courses include Data Structures & Algorithms Analysis and Design, System Software & Compiler Design, Digital Design, and Advanced Computer Networks. Exploring pedagogy alternatives to the "Language First" approach and help disseminate domain knowledge better are key to this effort. Further, the proposed curriculum provides stronger design emphasis, better match with industry's current and future needs, and supports better adaptability. The "Middle-Out Approach" also provides a better platform for lifelong learning. The major hurdle in the implementation of proposed curriculum would be the dissemination of the proposed approach to the CSE fraternity and availability of skilled faculty to handle the courses at various levels. Acceptance of this approach is more in the mindset of the professors; the ones who can see the inherent advantages will embrace this faster. There is also a need to develop books with a case-study approach with adequate design examples. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2009.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to show that pointing to patterns of change in the adoption and institutionalization of educational resources, the appropriateness of traditional heavy and front-loaded planning and management regimes is challenged in favor of alternative Agile Methods. Design/methodology/approach - Starting from the simple observation that the original introduction of Course Management Systems to support online learning was ad hoc and evolutionary, rather than planned at an enterprise level, the paper points to the conflict between, and offers a solution for, open and decentralized resources and traditional teaching, learning, support, and management. By developing a logic to decentralization, a number of managerial strategies to improve agility are provided that address the changing nature of the university from one fundamentally designed to control, to one positioned to influence and adapt under the assumptions of change. Findings - It is found that many components of the university including teaching, learning content, learning design, content development and management, and core infrastructure are shifting from centralized to decentralized models, while current management and governance practices remain centralized resulting in lagging development and increased risk. Originality/value - The connections made here open a dialog for challenging and changing traditional management and decision-making approaches within the organization, to better account for the environment that decentralized systems create. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Extreme programming (XP), arguably the most popular agile development methodology, is increasingly finding favor among software developers. Its adoption and acceptance require significant changes in work habits inculcated by traditional approaches that emphasize planning, prediction, and control. Given the growing interest in XP, it is surprising that there is a paucity of research articles that examine the factors that facilitate or hinder its adoption and eventual acceptance. This study aims to fill this void. Using a case study approach, we provide insights into individual, team, technological, task, and environmental factors that expedite or impede the organization-wide acceptance of XP. In particular, we study widely differing patterns of adherence to XP practices within an organization, and tease out the various issues and challenges posed by the adoption of XP. Based on our findings, we evolve factors and discuss their implications on the acceptance of XP practices. © 2009 Operational Research Society Ltd.},

abstract={Software development is a complex undertaking that continues to present software project teams with numerous challenges. Software project teams are adopting extreme programming (XP) practices in order to overcome the challenges of software development in an increasingly dynamic environment. The ability to coordinate software developers' efforts is critical in such conditions. Expertise coordination has been identified as an important emergent process through which software project teams manage non-routine challenges in software development. However, the extent to which XP enables software project teams to coordinate expertise is unknown. Drawing on the agile development and expertise coordination literatures, we examine the role of collective ownership and coding standards as processes and practices that govern coordination in software project teams. We examine the relationship between collective ownership, coding standards, expertise coordination, and software project technical quality in a field study of 56 software project teams comprising 509 software developers. We found that collective ownership and coding standards play a role in improving software project technical quality. We also found that collective ownership and coding standards moderated the relationship between expertise coordination and software project technical quality, with collective ownership attenuating the relationship and coding standards strengthening the relationship. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed. © 2009 Operational Research Society Ltd.},

abstract={In this paper, we address the efficacy and pragmatics of mixing two primary strategies for requirements prioritization in order to incorporate the benefits of both plan-based (PB) and agile development methods while avoiding their drawbacks. As it is intractable to directly study the performance of strategies on real projects, we conducted a comprehensive empirically based simulation under a variety of conditions of requirements dynamism, project size, and duration. Simulation results suggest that a mixed strategy for requirements prioritization seems to work best in all but cost for typical levels of dynamism on average. Our findings also indicate that, as theorized, PB and agile strategies perform well within opposite extremes of dynamism. However, they do not outperform the mixed strategies even within their home grounds- that is large and complex systems with stable requirements for PB, and small and dynamic projects for agile methods. Given the unknown, unknowable, or variable nature of dynamism and the dramatic differences in effectiveness for agile and PB strategies under extreme development scenarios, a mixed strategy appears to yield the best results overall. We introduce two mixed strategies- simply adding cost-benefit (CB) to the agile approach, and a more sophisticated hybrid (HY) approach that modulates development iteration size to maximize the expected CB for each iteration. We propose a step-by-step method to implement this HY strategy. We provide a structured analysis of the benefits and assumptions of agile and PB requirements prioritization methods (e.g., Pareto optimization), and outline a framework for analyzing and assessing the effectiveness of strategies including several new metrics. This research can furthermore serve as a framework for future validation of the proposed mixed strategies using actual software projects. © 2009 Operational Research Society Ltd.},

In order to succeed, control policies must look ahead to determine stabilizing actions, but such planning is complicated by frequent ground contacts that produce a discontinuous search space. This paper introduces a locomotion system that generates high-quality animation of agile movements using nonlinear controllers that plan through such contact changes. We demonstrate the general applicability of this approach by emulating walking and running motions in rigid-body simulations. Then we consolidate these controllers under a higher-level planner that interactively controls the character's direction. © 2009 ACM.},

Furthermore, it is demonstrated that a previously proposed factorisation-based autopilot design procedure for use with rigid aerospace vehicles may easily be adopted to arrive at lucid autopilots for flexible launch vehicles; this result is verified by a previously verified six degree-of-freedom simulation code. Although, both factorisation and QFT design approaches result in satisfactory autopilot systems, the factorisation design is simpler than that of QFT. The factorisation-based design man hour is considerably less than that of the QFT approach. Copyright © 2009, Inderscience Publishers.},

Thereby, the Alaska Simulator uses a journey as a metaphor for planning a software project. In the context of software project management the simulator can be used to compare traditional rather plan-driven project management methods with more agile approaches. Instead of pre-planning everything in advance agile approaches spread planning activities throughout the project and provide mechanisms for effectively dealing with uncertainty. The biggest challenge thereby is to find the right balance between pre-planning activities and keeping options open.

abstract={One of the most important factors for the success of a software application is user acceptance by having a usable user interface. Since summer 2007 in our project regarding mobile phone application, we have combined Extreme Programming and User-Centered Design methodologies aiming to deliver usable and useful software. The HCI instruments we have integrated are: user studies, personas, usability expert evaluations, usability tests, automated usability evaluations in the form of extended unit tests, as well as lightweight prototypes. After one and half years we conducted a retrospective full-day workshop with our off-site usability engineer to reflect on the adopted process regarding the HCI instruments. This paper presents those reflections - the lessons that we learned. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

Companies often feel proud in marketing themselves as 'agile'. However, the true notion of 'being agile' seems to have been overlooked due to lack of positioning of oneself for agility. This raises a call for more research and interactions between academia and the industry. The proposed workshop refers to this call. It will be highly relevant to participants, interested in positioning their company's agility from organizational, group or project perspectives. The positioning of agility will help companies to better align their agile practices with stakeholder values. Results of the workshop will be shared across participants and they will also have opportunity to continue their work on agile positioning in their companies.

Under this approach, ideas' generation, theories' selection or creation, methods' development, algorithms' design, and pilot prototype implementation are the intermediate tasks in the early stages of the process of development of CAD software. Theories, methods, algorithms, and pilot prototypes are the deliverables of these tasks. Each task involves stepwise translation of requirements into a respective deliverable.

It aims to demonstrate best practice in the use of software standards, development processes and evaluation. Design/methodology/approach - Web 2.0, open source design methods and usability testing were used within an agile framework. Findings - The adoption of agile software development methods, coupled with usability testing, would enable the library community to take full advantage of the techniques and principles inherent in Web 2.0 open source software. Research limitations/implications - A major component of the evaluation of OJAX was a series of usability tests. As is the nature of most usability studies, the results are not generalisable. Originality/value - Aspects of agile software development methods, such as usability testing and iterative design, are recognised in the literature as contributing to the usability of library software. However, exploration of the use of a full agile framework plus usability testing to facilitate Web 2.0 open source software is rare in library-related literature.

abstract={Cognitive radio is an exciting emerging technology that has the potential of dealing with the stringent requirement and scarcity of the radio spectrum. Such revolutionary and transforming technology represents a paradigm shift in the design of wireless systems, as it will allow the agile and efficient utilization of the radio spectrum by offering distributed terminals or radio cells the ability of radio sensing, self-adaptation, and dynamic spectrum sharing. Cooperative communications and networking is another new communication technology paradigm that allows distributed terminals in a wireless network to collaborate through some distributed transmission or signal processing so as to realize a new form of space diversity to combat the detrimental effects of fading channels. In this paper, we consider the application of these technologies to spectrum sensing and spectrum sharing. One of the most important challenges for cognitive radio systems is to identify the presence of primary (licensed) users over a wide range of spectrum at a particular time and specific geographic location. We consider the use of cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio systems to enhance the reliability of detecting primary users. We shall describe spectrum sensing for cognitive radios and propose robust cooperative spectrum sensing techniques for a practical framework employing cognitive radios. We also investigate cooperative communications for spectrum sharing in a cognitive wireless relay network. To exploit the maximum spectrum opportunities, we present a cognitive spacetimefrequency coding technique that can opportunistically adjust its coding structure by adapting itself to the dynamic spectrum environment. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={This article proposes a two-stage approach, based on the application of an analytic network process-mixed integer multi-objective programming (ANP-MIMOP) model, to solve the problem of partner selection in agile supply chains (ASCs). A key requirement of an ASC is that its constituents (suppliers, producers, distributors, etc.) can combine and react to fast-changing customer demand as efficiently and effectively as possible. An ASC needs to adopt the most appropriate supply chain structure and assign the most suitable order quantities to the most appropriate supply partners in any given circumstance. In the first stage, an ANP methodology is applied to calculate the priorities of different criteria for partner selection. Secondly, using these priorities, a MIMOP method is used to determine the supply chain structure and optimise the allocation of order quantities. An illustrative example is used to demonstrate the approach, obtain insights into its application and identify issues for future research.},

Such new capabilities have stimulated interest in exploiting agile transmitter capabilities. Although few demonstrations have been conducted on real radars or even test-bed systems, a significant corpus of theoretical and simulation results clearly indicates that waveform agility, if suitably applied, can yield highly substantial performance gains across different radar application scenarios. Most schemes introduced for exploiting waveform agility involve closed-loop waveform scheduling. Principled scheduling of waveforms in radar and other active sensing modalities is motivated by the nonexistence of any single waveform that is ideal for all situations encountered in typical operational scenarios. This then increases the possibility of achieving operationally significant performance gains through close-loop waveform scheduling.},

abstract={Barriers along a watercourse and interconnections between drainage systems are dynamic landscape elements that are expected to play major roles in the dispersal and genetic structure of fish species. The objective of this study was to assess the role of these elements using creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus) in the Mastigouche Wildlife Reserve (Québec, Canada) as model. Numerous impassable waterfalls and interconnections among drainage systems were inferred with geographic information systems and confirmed de visu. The analysis of 32 populations using seven nuclear microsatellites revealed the presence of three genetically distinct groups. Some groups were found upstream of impassable barriers and in adjacent portions of distinct drainage systems. Admixture among groups was also detected in some populations. Constraining phylogenetic procedures as well as Mantel correlation tests confirmed that the genetic structure is more likely to result from interconnections between the drainage systems than from the permanent network. This study indicates that landscape elements such as interconnections are of major importance for circumventing impassable barriers and colonizing lakes that are otherwise inaccessible. Such an approach could be relevant for determining the origins of fish species (i.e. native vs. introduced) in the context of conservation. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In today's fast paced military operational environment, vast amounts of information must be sorted out and fused not only to allow commanders to make situation assessments, but also to support the generation of hypotheses about enemy force disposition and enemy intent. Current information fusion technology has the following two limitations. First, current approaches do not consider the battlefield context as a first class entity. In contrast, we consider situational context in terms of terrain analysis and inference. Second, there are no integrated and implemented models of the high-level fusion process. This paper describes the HiLIFE (High-Level Information Fusion Environment) computational framework for seamless integration of high levels of fusion (levels 2, 3 and 4). The crucial components of HiLIFE that we present in this paper are: (1) multi-sensor fusion algorithms and their performance results that operate in heterogeneous sensor networks to determine not only single targets but also force aggregates, (2) computational approaches for terrain-based analysis and inference that automatically combine low-level terrain features (such as forested areas, rivers, etc.) and additional information, such as weather, and transforms them into high-level militarily relevant abstractions, such as NO-GO, SLOW-GO areas, avenues of approach, and engagement areas, (3) a model for inferring adversary intent by mapping sensor readings of opponent forces to possible opponent goals and actions, and (4) sensor management for positioning intelligence collection assets for further data acquisition. The HiLIFE framework closes the loop on information fusion by specifying how the different components can computationally work together in a coherent system. Furthermore, the framework is inspired by a military process, the Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield, that grounds the framework in practice. HiLIFE is integrated with a distributed military simulation system, OTBSAF, and the RETSINA multi-agent infrastructure to provide agile and sophisticated reasoning. In addition, the paper presents validation results of the automated terrain analysis that were obtained through experiments using military intelligence Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). © 2007.},

abstract={Service-oriented architectures (SOA) have been successfully adapted by agile businesses to support dynamic outsourcing of business processes and the maintenance of business ecosystems. Still, businesses need to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Abstract service interfaces, distributed ownership and cross-domain operations introduce new challenges for the implementation of compliance controls and the assessment of their effectiveness. In this paper, we analyze the challenges for automated support of the enforcement and evaluation of IT security controls in a SOA. We introduce these challenges by means of an example control, and outline a methodology and a high-level architecture that supports the phases of the control lifecycle through dedicated components for observation, evaluation, decision support and reaction. The approach is model-based and features policy-driven controls. A monitoring infrastructure assesses observations in terms of key indicators and interprets them in business terms. Reaction is supported through components that implement both automated enforcement and the provision of feedback by a human user. The resulting architecture essentially is a decoupled security architecture for SOA with enhanced analysis capabilities and will be detailed and implemented in the MASTER project.},

abstract={Agile software development is gaining popularity in industry. Anecdotal evidence to support this includes the emergence of agile practitioner journals and increasing attendance at agile-focused conferences. Many organizations are using agile methods because previously used techniques were not effective. Pair programming is probably the best known agile practice. Although controversial in both industry and academe, its use in education has been increasing, particularly in CS1. While some instructors fear that students may get a 'free ride' when pairing, empirical evidence shows that this is not the case. CS1 students who pair do as well in CS2 as students who worked by themselves in CS1, even when working alone in CS2 [1]. Pairing in CS1 leads to greater retention in the CS major, and also shows promise at reducing the gender gap in computing - the increase in retention among paired students is greater for women than it is for men [2]. The members of this panel argue that many other agile techniques can be used effectively in the CS curriculum. Collectively, we have more than 60 years of industrial experience; we feel that this gives us a clear understanding of the realities faced by students as they enter the workforce. Because of this, we strongly believe that students should be extensively exposed to agile practices. We have successfully taught agile techniques in courses ranging from introductory programming to the senior capstone. The benefits of this include increased student confidence and successful project delivery. We believe that agile techniques can be applied fruitfully in many other parts of the curriculum.},

However research has pointed to weaknesses in XP regarding supporting development of viable architectures. To strengthen XP in this regard a new practice: Developer Stories ([2]) was introduced in 2006 - mainly based on a theoretical argumentation. This paper reports from extensive experimentation with, and elaboration of the new practice. Results from this experimentation shows that using Developer Stories increases the likelihood of developing a viable architecture through a series of deliberate choices, through creating disciplined and recurring activities that: 1) Facilitate sharing and embodying of knowledge about architectural issues, and 2) heighten visibility of refactorings for both customers and developers. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

This approach itself is also problematic because it fails to convey the rationale and principles necessary to accommodate future changes. In response to this observation and disquieting trend, we propose a Value-Driven Agile Adoption (VDAA) approach that mandates the consideration of three value-based components when introducing agile practices. These three components represent values defined by (1) the agile community, (2) corporate identity and (3) business objectives. Consideration of each is accompanied by the rationale for the inclusion of some practices, and the exclusion of others. The VDAA approach embraces the philosophy that Agile is more than just a development process - it is a way to help organizations respond to long-term, as well as short-term changes.},

Taking a paradoxical perspective on responding to change vs. following a plan, and people vs. processes, this paper reveals that an agile process is a planning-driven process geared to responding to change, and it is a process that provides a supporting structure for people to learn and to improve their competences.},

abstract={There are many different techniques used with agile software development methods. Some of these, such as common coding guidelines and test driven development, are widely adopted and there appears to be a consensus that they can be beneficial. Others, however, are more controversial, none more so perhaps than pair programming. This technique meets resistance both from developers, who do not always wish to program with another person, and from managers, who see the sharing of a workstation as a potential barrier to programmer productivity. Its supporters, however, claim that it can have many benefits, in particular improving software quality. In this paper we look at the outcomes of previous research into the effects of pair programming and analyse some survey data to see how practitioners perceive its potential benefits for project outcomes in terms of quality, productivity, stakeholder satisfaction and cost. We conclude that the survey data appears to reinforce many of the previous claims made for the benefits of pair programming, but also raises questions that need further investigation. © 2008 David Parsons, Hokyoung Ryu and Ramesh Lal.},

abstract={The ability to build lean and agile supply chains has not developed as rapidly as anticipated, because the development of technology to manage such concepts of lean/agile for integrated supply chains is still under way. Also, due to ill-defined and vague indicators, which exist within leanness/agility assessment, many measures are described subjectively by linguistic terms, which are characterized by vagueness and multi-possibility, and the conventional assessment approaches cannot suitably or effectively handle such dynamic situations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to model agility (which includes leanness) and introduce dynamic agility level index (DALi) through fuzzy intelligent agents. Generally, it is difficult to emulate human decision making if the recommendations of the agents are provided as crisp, numerical values. The multiple intelligent agents used in this study communicate their recommendation as fuzzy numbers to accommodate ambiguity in the opinion and the data used for modelling agility attributes for integrated supply chains. Moreover, when agents operate based on different criteria pertaining to agility like flexibility, profitability, quality, innovativeness, pro-activity, speed of response, cost, robustness, etc., for integrated supply chains, the ranking and aggregation of these fuzzy opinions to arrive at a consensus is complex. The proposed fuzzy intelligent agents approach provides a unique and unprecedented attempt to determine consensus in these fuzzy opinions and effectively model dynamic agility. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated with the help of an illustrative example.},

abstract={The paper presents a cost reduction methodology to be deployed within the procurement function for enabling the more efficient operation and cost management of supply chains. Cost CENTRE-ing involves six procedural steps of: item Classification; data Encircling; cost driver Normalization; parameter Trending; cost Reduction identification; negotiated Enforcement. The methodology is applied to industrial case studies at Bombardier Aerospace Belfast for validation. The case studies embrace a representative range of procured aerospace parts in highlighting the generic nature of the method; including outside production, raw material and bought-out (vendor specialized) systems. The proposed methodology is applied in these three validation studies to show that it is effective over a wide range of applications (generic), has been used to significantly reduce the cost of supplied items (accurate), and is being adopted by a leading aerospace manufacturer (relevant). It is concluded that the proposed methodology exhibits all the above because it is based on an improved understanding of supply chain cost management; thereby contributing to the body of knowledge in terms of process understanding; the importance of a causal relations in estimating; and identifying inheritance and family relations in groups of products. It is shown that the Cost CENTRE-ing method provides an agile method for responsive cost analysis, estimation, control and reduction of procured aerospace parts. © 2008 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

abstract={In traditional engineering there is a clear consensus on how things should be built, what standards should be followed and what risks must be taken care of; if an engineer does not follow these practices and something goes wrong, he could get sued. There is no such consensus in software engineering: everyone promotes his or her own methods. The paper studies machine and software, their similarities and differences, and reaches the conclusion that the fundamental underpinning of traditional engineering design is embedded in physical principles and the fundamental underpinning of software design is embedded in arbitrary human imagination. The lack of a stable principle as the medium in software is the root cause of a huge amount of waste in the form of defective and failed software projects. Including the establishment of the missing underpinning in software development process as a first step holds the potential of bringing the maturity and success of conventional engineering to software industry. Reconstructing "physical principles" in software reconsiders the theoretical foundation of the software engineering discipline and its transformation into one comparable to any branch of conventional engineering in terms of success rate, predictability and product quality.},

abstract={In a competitive business landscape, large organizations such as insurance companies and banks are under high pressure to innovate, improvise and distinguish their products and services while continuing to reduce the time-to market for new product introductions. Generating a single view of the customer is vital from different perspectives of the systems developer over a period of time because of the existence of disconnected systems within an enterprise. Therefore, to increase revenues and cost optimization, it is important to build enterprise systems more closely with the business requirements by reusing the existing systems. While building distributed based applications, it is important to take into account the proven processes like Rational Unified Process (RUP) to mitigate risks and increase the reliability of systems. Experiences in developing applications in Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) with customized RUP have been presented in this paper. RUP is adopted into an onsite-offshore development model along with ISO 9001 and SEI CMM Level 5 standards. This paper provides an RUP approach to achieve increased reliability with higher productivity and lower defect density along with competitiveness through cost effective custom software solutions. Quantitative software reliability prediction is done using Generalized Stochastic Petri Nets, based on the RUP implemented prototype obtained from the PoC of a financial application prior to the actual implementation of the application development. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Along with the advances in wide-area network technologies and computer hardware, the increasing availability of powerful computers and high speed networks are changing the high performance computing paradigm today. Recent related research has led to the emergence of a new paradigm known as grid computing. A major motivation of grid computing is to aggregate the power of widely distributed resources to provide services to users. Several unique characteristics of this paradigm make the development of grid software more challenging. In order to develop grid-aware applications, software engineering principles (e.g. software process, life-cycle model) for building conventional software must be adopted to cope with these challenges. Nowadays two kinds of software processes are frequently mentioned: heavyweight and lightweight. In this paper, we address the issues of comparing the two kinds of processes and selecting the better one for developing grid software. We choose to examine two well-known software processes: IEEE 1074 [6] and Extreme Programming [1], which respectively represents heavyweight process and lightweight process. They are first examined in detail and a comparison between them is conducted. Then we present a selection guide to choose the better methodology for a grid software project. Our analysis shows that lightweight software processes such as XP are more suitable for developing grid software. Copyright 2008 ACM.},

First, both emphasize a "learn by doing" approach consistent with the Polytechnic mission. Second, both engage students in entrepreneurship through a variety of activities. We believe the latter point is especially important; in our view entrepreneurship is often promoted through a single highly visible activity. Our approach embeds entrepreneurship across the spectrum of student engagement. This reflects our belief that students must engage repeatedly with entrepreneurs to understand and adopt this cultural norm.

abstract={Fractionated Space Systems, as exemplified by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Future Fast, Flexible, Fractionated, Free-Flying Spacecraft united by Information eXchange (DARPA's System F6), represent real challenges to software cost estimation. The concept is a traditional 'monolithic' spacecraft is replaced by a cluster of wirelessly interconnected spacecraft modules to create a virtual satellite, delivering capability which is at least equivalent to the monolithic spacecraft. Concurrently, they significantly enhance flexibility and system robustness, and reduce risk throughout the mission life and the spacecraft development cycle. Such systems present real challenges to software cost estimation which arise from both the concept of a Directed System of Systems (DSOS) and the reduced risk which is primarily achievable only through the application of an Incremental Commitment Model (ICM). This paper will briefly introduce a next-generation synthesis of the spiral model and other leading process models into the ICM, which is being piloted or considered for adoption in some parts of Department of Defense (DoD). The ICM emphasizes architecting systems (or DSOSs) to encapsulate subsystems (or systems) undergoing the most rapid change; and architecting the incremental development process by having agile systems engineers handling longer-range change traffic to rebaseline the plans for future increments while largely plandriven teams develop and continuously verify and validate (V&V) the current increment, as is usually required for safe or secure software. One approach being followed for estimating the software development cost of the Fractionated Space Craft Systems of Systems (FSSOS) is based on the Constructive Incremental Commitment Cost Model (COINCOMO) model and its tool which currently implements together in one tool the Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO II), the Constructive Phased Schedule and Effort Model (COPSEMO) and a Constructive Security Cost Model (COSECMO). COINCOMO has an added super-structure to accommodate multiple suppliers of independent software subsystems and multiple builds (or incremental deliveries). Many software systems components today rely on Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) sub-components and/or reuse of (potentially proprietary) open-source or legacy components which are treated like COTS components rather than reused, modified components, and adapted/reused open-source subcomponents, as well as new code. The COINCOMO model also accommodates them without the name-space explosion that happened in COCOMO II. COINCOMO 2.0 is implemented in a database-centric fashion designed with the ability to save and reuse any of the sets of parameters thus making it much easier to do what-if and evolving estimates.

abstract={One of the most important phases regarding Software Project Management is planning. On this phase, efforts and resources estimation must be taken into account considering human, materials, infrastructure, time, and budget. Generally, it depends on technical, environmental, human and political factors. It also can affect software final cost and development effort. The estimation tackled on this work was based on Use Case Points (UCP) effort estimation technique, introduced by Gustav Karner in 1993. This paper considered both the best and the worst scenarios for developing a software product. It helped to verify and reveal which are the activities that may cause project lateness. The major contribution of this work was to provide acceptable software estimation for avionics system development and case study integration for an Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Project. The UCP effort estimation was applied to just one UAS named Preliminary Testing Monitoring Station (PTMS). That system was considered as a key part of the UAS Project. The strategy to get accurate estimate was the utilization of a well-defined software process, where documentation was continuously improved. This work has adopted Rational Unified Process (RUP), Unified Modeling Language (UML), and Object-Orientation (OO). RUP has a specific artifact for use case models and the estimation was accomplished by taking information from this artifact. Another contribution of this work was the development of a software tool based upon the UCP technique. At the end, this paper reports significant estimate results to help project managers taking important decisions throughout the project development life-cycle. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={The RToolkit is an open source, cross platform object oriented distributed simulation framework for rapid HLA federate development. The framework provides an infrastructure between low level RTI API and simulation code to simplify RTI integration, to improve extensibility of federates and insulation of federates against different HLA versions. It supports both DoD 1.3 and IEEE 1516 HLA standards with a unified and simplified API and enables developers to implement federates compatible with both standards without rewriting the source code. The RToolkit is FOM agile and can be easily customized for different FOMs. The framework is implemented in C++. Well known design patterns and object oriented programming paradigms are used during design and implementation. This paper describes the architectural foundations and functionality of the RToolkit. The framework is expected to provide an abstract reusable design for developers to decrease efforts associated with federate and federation development and maintenance process, and to improve software quality through reuse. Virtually, The RToolkit can be adopted to every RTI implementation that conforms to either DoD 1.3 or IEEE HLA 1516 standards, or both. Copyright © 2008, SISO, Inc.},

abstract={KBoard is a software environment developed to facilitate group work conducted in multimedia collaboration rooms. Specifically, KBoard has been designed to support the process of capturing knowledge during group sessions in which interaction among participants is mediated by large interactive displays. We focus on two main requirements arising in this setting: (1) Users need agile and unobtrusive means to persistently represent their ideas and build associations among them; and (2) Users need to easily enter text without relying on conventional mouse and keyboard facilities. KBoard addresses these needs by (1) implementing the notion of workspaces that are built and inter-linked as discussion progresses and knowledge is shared by group members; and (2) providing alternative dynamic QWERTY and pie-menu virtual keyboards that speed up text input. As per our preliminary evaluation of KBoard, this combination results in a powerful environment that facilitates knowledge capture and offers an appealing toolset to explore more fully the potential of large interactive displays and to promote the adoption of multimedia collaboration rooms to support creative group activities.},

In this paper, we introduce a refactoring approach that can be used during evolutionary MAS development. The proposed refactoring approach makes it possible to develop MASs in an evolutionary way by managing the changes between the iterations of the evolutionary development process. Also, a case study that shows application of a refactoring technique during the evolutionary MAS development is introduced in the fifth section. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Key challenges of finding right skilled resources and the cost arbitrage factors have made distributed software development indispensable for quite some time now. The success stories of many ojfshore service providers particularly from India underlines the fact that this is working well in a "hands-free" mode, especially for projects following traditional development life cycles. The recent trend is an increase in the number of organizations adopting agile methodologies to tackle the challenges of requirements volatility and shorter time to market. However, the concept of a collocated team which is central to agile does not easily translate to distributed development. This paper captures our experience at Wipro in handling Distributed Agile projects. We discuss a validated model to make a smooth transition from a collocated to a distributed scenario in agile projects. We also share the lessons learnt and best practices that we have gained in implementing this model. © 2008 IEEE.},

These organizations carry out activities that might be undertaken in a plan driven and agile manner with the support of such tools. A proper balance between both approaches and the effective tool adoption will help organizations to meet their objectives and evolve. Small and medium enterprises and Cooperatives (S&C) share common characteristics throughout Latin America. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) lack of formality in their roles and relationships among interacting individuals, whereas Cooperatives are usually small companies with weaknesses as to management techniques and technological equipment. In fact, both have difficulties when finding the right personnel and tools that best suit their needs. Considering Venezuela as our study subject, we have herein proposed some criteria to assist S&C in the tools selection that support their development processes while fostering the balance required between agility and discipline. Such criteria were formulated based on the characterization of five factors aimed at determining this balance. These contributions will help subsequently identifying methodological and technical aspects to provide guidance to S&C in the improvement of their development processes.},

Data modelers however important in the traditional mainframe technology, and their role in the two-tier, client-server world is equally critical. Object-modeling techniques, such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML), are significantly more robust than data-modeling techniques and are a data-modeling superset.

abstract={The adoption of extreme programming (XP) method requires a very peculiar cultural context in software development companies. However, stakeholders do not always consider this matter and tend to stand to technical requirements of the method. Hence this paper aims at identifying aspects of organizational culture that may influence favorably or unfavorably the use of XP. In order to identify those aspects, this study analyzes dimensions of organizational culture under the perspective of practices and values of XP.

abstract={Enterprises have to be increasingly agile and responsive to address the challenges posed by the fast moving market. With the software architecture evolving into service-oriented architecture, and the adoption of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), event processing can fit well in enterprise information systems in terms of facilitation of event aggregation into high level actionable information, and event response to improve the responsiveness. To make it more applicable, the architecture of event processing in enterprise information systems is proposed; event meta model is put forth, and the rules are defined. To improve the detect efficiency, classification and partition of event instance is utilized. We have implemented the event processing mechanism in enterprise information systems based on RFID, including the data structures, optimization strategies and algorithm that is considered as one of the contributions. The performance evaluations show that the method is effective in terms of scalability and the capability of event processing. Complex event processing can improve operation efficiency and discover more actionable information, which is justified by the application. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={The Army is transforming into a more lethal, lighter and agile force. Enabling technologies that support this transition must decrease in size while increasing in intelligence. Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) are one such technology that the Army and DoD will rely on heavily to accomplish these objectives. Conditions for utilization of MEMS by the military are unique. Operational and storage environments for the military are significantly different than those found in the commercial sector. Issues unique to the military include: high G-forces during gun launch, extreme temperature and humidity ranges, extended periods of inactivity (20 years plus) and interaction with explosives and propellants. The military operational environments in which MEMS will be stored or required to function are extreme and far surpass any commercial operating conditions. The impact of these environments on the functionality of MEMS has not been assessed. Furthermore, a standardized methodology for conducting these analyses does not exist. To facilitate the insertion of MEMS technologies in weapon systems, U.S. Army ARDEC is addressing the information gaps delineated above. This will benefit the MEMS user community by providing data on failure modes induced by packaging, transportation and storage for selected devices. These data will then be used to develop a impacts in the early stages of development.},

abstract={As web based-applications become increasingly important to all aspects of life, there is a need to encourage practitioners to adopt best practices so as to improve the quality of the processes in use, and therefore achieve targets related to time, budget and quality. The web development industry worldwide is dominated by a myriad of small firms. This presents a challenge in terms of determining the current practices of industry participants, and in devising improvement initiatives which are feasible for small firms. The objectives of this research is to propose a software process model framework that assists the small firms in designing web based-applications so as not to run over budget and time. To achieve these objectives, an extensive literature survey of web development methodologies and software process improvement in small firms were conducted to identify web engineering practice in web development. The literature survey clarified that, there were several development methodologies of web-based application. These studies have not taken into consideration software process improvements. A software process framework for internet development in small firms is proposed in this research. This framework contains several steps to follow; the first step is to begin with small web project. The second steps is adopt the modified XP process model which is also a suggested process model for internet development in small firms, and then apply XXPM as a quality model for software process improvement. If the proposed software process framework is to be successful then it must be laid on web engineering practices. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Those who implement agile software development and agile project management in a traditional corporate environment may encounter legacy corporate and IT processes that reflect legacy mindsets and cultures. These remnant processes, mindsets, and cultures represent opportunities to improve the systemic value that agile approaches are capable of enabling. For example, in many large corporations the annual budgeting cycle drives a mindset that scope, budget, and schedule must be established up front, often many months before project work begins. Success means delivering on that scope within the budget and schedule commitments. In turn, this mindset of defining business investment opportunities upfront, coupled with a project mentality where work must be completed before the next budgeting cycle begins, drives "big batch" (waterfall-type) project approaches and supporting IT processes. As our IT teams successfully applied agile methods at the project level, we began to address our approach for managing portfolios of projects to increase the amount of value we deliver with our business partners. As we did this, we ran headlong into inherent conflicts between agile and legacy corporate processes and mindsets. We recognized the need to transform those legacy processes and mindsets so that we manage the portfolios of project investments in an agile manner. This paper describes the challenges we faced as we applied agile methods to IT investment funding, change management, and governance; the success and failures we experienced; what we learned; and how we adapted to improve. © 2008 IEEE.},

While there are success stories and recommendations, there is little scientifically valid evidence of the challenges in the adoption of Agile methods in general, and Scrum in particular. Little, if anything, is empirically known about the application and adoption of Scrum in a multi-team and multi-project situation. The authors carried out an ethnographically informed longitudinal case study in industrial settings and closely followed how the Scrum method was adopted in a 20-person department, working in a simultaneous multi-project R&D environment. Altogether 10 challenges pertinent to the case of multi-team multi-project Scrum adoption were identified in the study.

To specifically address the latter challenge, we created a lightweight release framework in order to optimize on-time, high quality delivery to our customers and partners. The fundamentals of this framework and approach emphasize supporting and enabling the development teams rather than controlling them, through a release framework-simple, lightweight, unambiguous, visible everywhere. By implementing this lightweight release framework and making it highly visible, we've promoted rhythm and flow within and across all scrum teams. In doing so, we have been able to develop a stable rhythm for delivering on-time, high-quality releases in a complex environment, while not compromising our Agile principles. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={The ability of agile practices to scale to "large" software development efforts (more than three teams or 30 team members) has been widely debated in recent years. While a variety of inhibitors to scaling agile are frequently cited, this experience report describes how the primary challenge to scaling agile that we faced was finding the right people to build our agile tribe. The effective adoption of Agile requires passionate, motivated individuals who accept change, think like a business owner, operate willingly outside team walls, and identify and drive program issues. Finding such a large number of people with these qualities is much more difficult than establishing methods to support communications, progress tracking, and other agile practices. We conclude by describing the attributes of the type of person that we believe will thrive in a large-scale Agile shop. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={In agile software development, planning meetings play a pivotal role in establishing a concrete understanding of customers' requirements. Using tools to enhance the effectiveness of the planning meetings without affecting the agility of the practices or disturbing the traditional settings is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose the use of digital tabletops as a means of collaboration in agile planning meetings for collocated teams. To support this proposal, we introduce Agile Planner for Digital Tabletops, a planning tool that was specifically designed for use on large horizontal displays. A multipart study involving a variety of qualitative methodologies was conducted to evaluate this approach. The study involved 14 individual participants plus a five member agile team. The individual evaluation suggested that in general, the tool is usable with minor issues to be considered in future design revisions. The agile team evaluation revealed a significant interest in the tool and its added benefits to the agility of the planning meeting with some issues to be further enhanced. © 2008 IEEE.},

It is not only a call for flexibility, but also recognition that the movement of a team from one iteration to another is a seamless process of systematic, organic growth, rather than a hierarchical set of hurdles. Used in combination these two frameworks reinforce each other and can be used to establish a productive learning environment. © 2008 IEEE.},

KBB's use of SharePoint was nascent at the time and was a fine tool for several small Scrum teams. However with the total number of teams now at fifteen, SharePoint alone was just not keeping pace with the needs of the organization. Deciding to move to a more robust tool to promote agility while keeping up with product release plans can be a complicated challenge. KBB chose VersionOne to replace SharePoint. Migration to VersionOne involved numerous departments and two offshore facilities. With KBB sharing their experience of this common situation, other companies can learn about and adopt proven techniques to ensure a successful tool migration.

In this experience report, the focus is on sharing the problems teams can encounter with transparency if they do not manage the transition to electronic tools well. We discuss the implications for agile development teams along with the strengths and weaknesses of physical and electronic information radiators. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={A type of passive pulling type xylophone-playing robot (PPXR) is presented based on the special demands of playing xylophone. Its integrated structure and working principle are introduced. Its control system and important performance parameters are also discussed. PPXR consists of two mallet-moving devices, two mallet-beating devices, an industry control computer, a motion controller, control software, a human body shape model and a xylophone. Positions of mallet-moving are controlled by two slide seats which are driven by two servo motors independently. Two mallet-beating devices are driven by two mini servo motors respectively. Two hands of the human body shape model are moved following with two mallet-moving devices respectively. The mallet-moving structure, mallet-beating structure and human body shape structure are designed. Its control system and motion controller have also been analyzed. Its control system adopts host computer and slave computer model. Communication and data transfer mode are discussed between industry control computer and motion controller. The results show that synchronistic belts and slide path reliably ensured position accuracy when two mallet-moving devices move. Digital signal processing chip is used for the motion controller and CAN communication bus satisfies the demand of real time performance. The robot has simple structure, agile action, little inertia and accurate playing positioning. PPXR can play some un-complex music according to music control programs in host computer. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Due to the complexity and size of embedded software together with strong demands on time-to-market and quality, testing is a crucial point that should be addressed during software development. Traditionally, testing is carried out during the last phases of the software development life cycle. As a consequence, testing activities are often subject to high time pressure, which either results in delayed market introduction or low product quality. The validation of functional and real-time requirements of embedded systems is a difficult task. It usually needs the electronic control unit and the controlled hardware components. But very often the hardware components are not available for testing the control software at the beginning of the development. In this paper, we paper presents how test cases can be designed from use cases and how embedded control software can be validated without hardware components by simulating the test cases in early development phases using the AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming). For achieving an aspect oriented testable format, extended UML sequence diagrams are applied to formalize sequences of events, which have been specified in the use case scenarios. Provided that black box aspect oriented is used for developing embedded component applications, the monitoring of the dynamic behavior inside the components is not possible during simulation. But the simulated dynamic behavior is observable on the connections between the software components. In such a way monitored and recorded time stamp events are finally compared offline against the expected sequences of events specified in the test cases. The offline comparison validates the simulated behavior by demonstrating the fulfillment of user requirements and by detecting errors in case of contradictions during modeling. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

However, there is a problem in scaling up scrum and other agile methods, since these were originally meant for individual team scope. It is not enough to deploy agile methods only on the team level - because of the dependencies that teams have between each other when developing large software systems, and because the software engineering teams need input for their decision making (or actual decisions) and need to be synchronized with other activities. We present one way of scaling up scrum to program level consisting of several scrum teams, concentrating on the changes done in the process front-end. We also describe a new artifact called Agile Policy that was created for large-scale agile deployment. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={The vast amount of published literature explaining the "right way" of doing Extreme Programming (XP) shows that in practice, there simply is no single right way. Even though XP is a simple and slim process, it has to be tailored to the nature of each team and project in order to provide the benefits it promises. Our team has been working on a project employing the XP methodology, experiencing unique issues arising from the distinct project setup and team composition, as well as the additional academic interests in the project. Initially, we aimed at applying "pure XP", but it became more and more obvious that for our project some of the practices just cannot be applied in their "pure" form. The concrete interpretation of these practices determines if XP can be applied successfully in the context of a team and a project. In order to reach an optimized process for our project, we continuously evaluate different approaches of applying XP practices on short release basis. We have noticed that some practices can be adopted directly while others need to be tailored according to the unique environment. In this paper we reflect on our process based on the data collected through code analysis and process evaluation tools, as well as notes of process retrospective review meetings. The lessons we have learned can also help other teams to lead them to an optimized XP process for the success of their projects. ©2008 IEEE.},

Our approach is oriented on the guideline life-cycle and takes the requirements and the interactions of the various actors into account to formalize guidelines in a computer-interpretable guideline representation by using a semi-automatic way based on NLP techniques.

abstract={Agile processes play an important role in the author's undergraduate course in software engineering. The course is a required course for undergraduate majors in Computer Science. Agile processes, like eXtreme Programming (XP), have been criticized for not providing a good framework for building secure software. The course begins by covering what some people have called "the war" between the traditional waterfall process folks and the agile process folks. After students are given an introduction to various processes on both sides of "the war" (with an emphasis on PSP, CMMI and XP) and after students are introduced to basic concepts about how to make software systems more secure (drawing heavily on Viega and McGraw's book Building Secure Software), the course turns its attention to how XP (in particular) can be made more secure. This topic generates a lot of enthusiasm among the students. The students seem to enjoy the challenge of creating new ideas to improve the manner in which XP addresses security issues. Students have come up with many creative and stimulating ideas about how extreme Programming can be made more secure without the necessity for what some have called "big up front design". This paper presents some of the creative ideas students have come up with regarding this issue and discusses the team projects that give students the opportunity to explore security issues for agile processes in some depth. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Cardiac modelling is the area of physiome modelling where the available simulation software is perhaps most mature, and it therefore provides an excellent starting point for considering the software requirements for the wider physiome community. In this paper, we will begin by introducing some of the most advanced existing software packages for simulating cardiac electrical activity. We consider the software development methods used in producing codes of this type, and discuss their use of numerical algorithms, relative computational efficiency, usability, robustness and extensibility.We then go on to describe a class of software development methodologies known as test-driven agile methods and argue that such methods are more suitable for scientific software development than the traditional academic approaches. A case study is a project of our own, Cancer, Heart and Soft Tissue Environment, which is a library of computational biology software that began as an experiment in the use of agile programming methods. We present our experiences with a review of our progress thus far, focusing on the advantages and disadvantages of this new approach compared with the development methods used in some existing packages.We conclude by considering whether the likely wider needs of the cardiac modelling community are currently being met and suggest that, in order to respond effectively to changing requirements, it is essential that these codes should be more malleable. Such codes will allow for reliable extensions to include both detailed mathematical models-of the heart and other organs-and more efficient numerical techniques that are currently being developed by many research groups worldwide. © 2008 The Royal Society.},

abstract={In global software development (GSD) projects, distributed teams collaborate to deliver high-quality software. Project managers need to control these development projects, which increasingly adopt agile practices. However, in a distributed project a major challenge is to keep all team members aware of recent changes of requirements and project status without providing too little or too much information for each role. In this paper we introduce a framework to define notification for development team members that allows a) measurement of notification effectiveness, efficiency, and cost; b) formalizing key communication in an agile environment; and c) providing a method and a tool to implement communication support. We illustrate, with an example scenario from an industry background, the concept and report results from an initial empirical evaluation. From the evaluation it follows that the concept allows determining and increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of key communication in a global software development project in a sufficiently formal way without compromising the use of agile practices. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Software customers want both sufficient product quality and agile response to requirements changes. Formal software requirements tracing helps to systematically determine the impact of changes and to keep track of development artifacts that need to be re-tested when requirements change. However, full tracing of all requirements on the most detailed level can be very expensive and time consuming. In the paper an initial "tracing activity model" is introduced along with a framework that allows measuring the expected cost and benefit of tracing approaches. In a feasibility study a subset of the activities belonging to the model has been applied to compare three tracing strategies: agile, "just in time" tracing, and fully formal tracing. The study focused on re-testing and it has been performed in the context of an industry project where the customer was a large financial service provider.In the study a) the model was found useful to capture costs and benefits of the tracing activities and to compare different strategies; b) a combination of tracing approaches proved helpful in balancing agility and formalism. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Software development projects are a complex undertaking. Aside from the technical aspects, numerous difficulties arise in their management. A one-size-fits-all, top-down methodology does not work, due to the nature of software projects and the people involved. In the last few years, there has been a trend away from command and control development processes toward people-centric processes such as Extreme Programming, Scrum, Crystal Clear, Feature-Driven Development. People-centric software development processes often fall under the term Agile Software Development. Despite the maturity of these processes as well as a significant number of publications and training describing them, organizations are not always well positioned to adopt the most effective agile software development processes due to the difficulty in creating a supportive organization. One way to understand the cultural and organizational orientations needed to support agile development processes is to view the organizational behavior with a metaphor. For example, the metaphor of software as a collaborative game has been widely used as one way to better understanding agile development. Organizational behavior styles are another way to gain understanding of organizational orientations. In organizational design, for example, there are two dominant orientations: the first orientation is bureaucratic, with strict hierarchy, authoritative power positions (e.g. command and control) and an emphasis on maintaining conformity with the status quo. The second orientation is the postindustrial, with decentralized and lateral structure, team-based and mission centered, with reciprocal power relations, emphasizing employee creative thinking and initiative. The postindustrial orientation, oriented toward people rather than structure, has a stronger affinity for the logic underlying agile software development and is difficult to apply. The question is, what organizational metaphor can be effectively applied to underlying organizational orientation needed to support agile software development process? To provide a tentative answer, scholars in organization theory and design have posited the jazz metaphor to theorize how we conceive the organizational dynamics inherent in the postindustrial organization. From the point for this article, it is argued the jazz metaphor better elucidates the supportive organizational culture required to effectively use an agile software development processes, specifically Scrum. The purpose of this article is to explore the jazz metaphor as it applies to a representative agile software development methodology, ultimately building a case that the metaphor can be used as a mechanism to better understand the organizational behavior required for self-emerging behavior often exhibited in teams using the representative agile development methodology. We will introduce and develop a linkage between organizational behavior in the context of a postindustrial orientation and the collaborative behaviors often exhibited in agile software development, using Scrum as a basis for the comparison; then explore the jazz metaphor as it relates to organizational behavior. Finally, we will explore the jazz improvisation metaphor as an effective way to reconceive organizational behavior exhibited in our representative software development methodology: Scrum. Ultimately, our intent will be to establish the jazz improvisation metaphor as a basis for further exploration into the understanding of agile software development methodology team behavior.

A challenge with introducing agile software development is that it requires a high level of both individual and team autonomy. This paper studies the barriers with introducing self-organizing teams in agile software development and presents data from a seven month ethnographic study of professional developers in a Scrum team. We found the most important barrier to be the highly specialized skills of the developers and the corresponding division of work. In addition we found a lack of system for team support, and reduced external autonomy to be important barriers for introducing self-organizing teams. These findings have implications for software development managers and practitioners. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={There is often a misconception that adopting and tailoring agile methods is straightforward resulting in improved products and increasingly satisfied customers. However, the empirical nature of agile methods means that potential practitioners need to carefully assess whether they are exposed to the risks that can make agile method adoption problematic. This is particularly the case with small software companies who are less able to absorb the impact of failed experimentation. This study describes a minimally intrusive assessment approach for small software companies preparing for agile method adoption and tailoring in the light of key risks. The approach has been conducted with six small software companies, three of which are presented to show the evolution of the approach, describe the resource commitment that companies have to make, and highlight the type of information generated from an assessment. The contribution of this study is that small software companies have an alternative to 'mere experimentation' with agile methods and can take reasoned steps towards their adoption and tailoring.

The search strategy identified 1996 studies, of which 36 were identified as empirical studies. The studies were grouped into four themes: introduction and adoption, human and social factors, perceptions on agile methods, and comparative studies. The review investigates what is currently known about the benefits and limitations of, and the strength of evidence for, agile methods. Implications for research and practice are presented. The main implication for research is a need for more and better empirical studies of agile software development within a common research agenda.

abstract={Open Source Software development is seen as a panacea by many companies. The promise of community-style development, innovation and cost savings drive the wider adoption of OSS in companies. However, it is still difficult to institutionalize the open and agile culture of sharing innovation especially into larger departmentalized organizations. The aim of this research paper is to investigate the characteristics of one successful OSS development implementation approach limited inside a company (Inner source). Based on our data, we argue that there are possibilities for employing OSS as a new kind of development process within a company and leveraging thus the innovation potential inside the company. © 2008 International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={The principles behind the agile development methods and common practise within the Open Source community are vastly different. In recent years there has been a rise of interest in these, in order to detect and inform on areas of compatible shared practises. This paper argues that it is possible to quantify the level of agility displayed by Open Source projects. An indicator of agility, the Mean Developer Engagement (MDE) metric is introduced and tested through the analysis of public project data. Projects sampled from two repositories (KDE and SourceForge) are studied and a hypothesis is formulated: projects from the two samples display a similar level of MDE. This paper provides two main contributions: first, the MDE metric is shown to vary significantly between the KDE and SourceForge projects. Second, by combining MDE with a project's lifespan, it is also shown that SourceForge projects have insufficient uptake of new developers resulting in more active, shorter, initial activity, and in a quicker "burning out" of the projects. © 2008 International Federation for Information Processing.},

The users will be requiring an agile database administrator (DBA) who is skilled in techniques such as database refactoring, continuous database integration, database regression testing, and agile data modeling in medium-sized agile team. The typical strategy of the big-size agile is to organize the larger team of more than 20 members into a collection of smaller teams and each subteam should be responsible for one or more subsystems, enabling them to work as a small agile team responsible for delivering working software on a timely basis.},

Service-oriented software technologies provide promising means to regulate and enforce coordination of cross-organisational software service interactions but miss organisational abstractions and methodology. This paper proposes a conceptual reference model of collaborative network coordination that satisfies flexibility and agility requirements of virtual organisation by building on common software service abstractions and lifecycle methodology. In particular, the model focuses collaborative service networks and introduces the concept of virtual business service that represents business service processes as software service abstractions and supports flexible regulation and agile enforcement of their coordination by means of software service lifecycle methodology. For demonstration and evaluation purpose, we present a case study of service-oriented systems analysis for virtual organisation of a collaborative e-science network that adopts our conceptual reference model. © 2008 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

Test-driven development has recently re-emerged as a critical enabling practice of agile software development methodologies. However, little empirical evidence supports or refutes the utility of this practice in an industrial context. Case studies were conducted with three development teams at Microsoft and one at IBM that have adopted TDD. The results of the case studies indicate that the pre-release defect density of the four products decreased between 40% and 90% relative to similar projects that did not use the TDD practice. Subjectively, the teams experienced a 15-35% increase in initial development time after adopting TDD. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) is a new computing paradigm that utilizes services as the basic constructs to support the development of rapid, low-cost and easy composition of distributed applications even in heterogeneous environments. The promise of Service-Oriented Computing is a world of cooperating services where application components are assembled with little effort into a network of services that can be loosely coupled to create flexible dynamic business processes and agile applications that may span organizations and computing platforms. The subject of Service-Oriented Computing is vast and enormously complex, spanning many concepts and technologies that find their origins in diverse disciplines that are woven together in an intricate manner. In addition, there is a need to merge technology with an understanding of business processes and organizational structures, a combination of recognizing an enterprise's pain points and the potential solutions that can be applied to correct them. The material in research spans an immense and diverse spectrum of literature, in origin and in character. As a result research activities are very fragmented. This necessitates that a broader vision and perspective be established - one that permeates and transforms the fundamental requirements of complex applications that require the use of the Service-Oriented Computing paradigm. This paper provides a Service Oriented Computing Roadmap and places on-going research activities and projects in the broader context of this roadmap. This research roadmap launches four pivotal, inherently related, research themes to Service-Oriented Computing: service foundations, service composition, service management and monitoring and service-oriented engineering. © 2008 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={The emergence of agile software development methodologies, and the sheer number of the variants introduced, has raised the need for evaluation and comparison efforts, mostly in order to facilitate the selection or engineering of an agile methodology aimed at a specific software development situation. But existing evaluation frameworks and comparison tools do not satisfy all the needs of project managers and method engineers. The principal objectives of this paper are to introduce a fundamental basis for evaluation frameworks that target existing challenges, and also to evaluate existing evaluation frameworks in order to identify their shortcomings. To this aim, we have proposed an evaluation criterion set, or metacriteria, according to which existing evaluation frameworks have been assessed. These meta-criteria define the essential features that an appropriate evaluation framework is expected to possess. The evaluation results show that existing evaluation frameworks do not satisfy typical requirements, and fail to address existing challenges. Therefore, the need still remains for an appropriate and useful evaluation framework for appraising agile methodologies. © 2008 IEEE.},

At the specification / validation phase, we adopt a variant of MAUDE that we endow with strategy for controlling rules and state splitting / recombining for exhibiting full intra-concurrency. For the verification / refinement phase, we automatically derive TLA 's formulas from validated MAUDE specification, on which crucial properties are checked using TLA 's deductions and invariants.

abstract={Increasingly, information systems must be developed and implemented as a part of business change. This is a challenge for the IS project manager, since business change and information systems development usually are performed as separate processes. Thus, there is a need to understand and manage the relationship between these two kinds of processes. To understand the interaction between information systems development and planned organizational change we introduce the concept of process interaction. We draw on a longitudinal case study of an IS development project that used an iterative and incremental development approach. The concept of process interaction enabled us to understand critical events in the case, in particular those that were important for the mutual adaptation between the information system and the organization. We conclude that process interaction is needed to facilitate socio-technical innovation in a situation where the organizational change process and the IS development process are parallel but incongruent. We also argue that iterative software engineering frameworks are well structured to support process interaction. Finally, we advocate that the IS project manager needs to manage the trade-off between necessary process interaction and the internal IS project schedule. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Projects are living entities. They are born with the project idea and end with the project termination. The time in between can last for many years, in most of the cases, requiring continuous implementation and management effort. Over the time project changes on requirements change the implementation process and in turn the management process, the maintenance process and so on. In order to maintain qualitative and quantitative project results both the project implementation and management processes need to be adjusted in the overall project changes and environment. This adjustment can be made by using agile project management methodologies, defining processes based on the identification of the project goals, constraints and expatiations. Unfortunately that is not enough, and projects, especially software projects are still in implementation and management crisis.

abstract={Background. The explosive epidemics of dengue that have been occurring in various countries have stimulated investigation into new approaches to improve understanding of the problem and to develop new strategies for controlling the disease. The objective of this study was to evaluate the characteristics of diffusion of the first dengue epidemic that occurred in the city of Salvador in 1995. Methods. The epidemiological charts and records of notified cases of dengue in Salvador in 1995 constituted the source of data. The cases of the disease were georeferenced according to census areas (spatial units) and epidemiological weeks (temporal unit). Kernel density estimation was used to identify the pattern of spatial diffusion using the R-Project computer software program. Results. Of the 2,006 census areas in the city, 1,400 (70%) registered cases of dengue in 1995 and the spatial distribution of these records revealed that by the end of 1995 practically the entire city had been affected by the virus, with the largest concentration of cases occurring in the western region, composed of census areas with a high population density and predominantly horizontal residences compared to the eastern region of the city, where there is a predominance of vertical residential buildings. Conclusion. The pattern found in this study shows the characteristics of the classic process of spreading by contagion that is common to most infectious diseases. It was possible to identify the epicenter of the epidemic from which centrifugal waves of the disease emanated. Our results suggest that, if a more agile control instrument existed that would be capable of rapidly reducing the vector population within a few days or of raising the group immunity of the population by means of a vaccine, it would theoretically be possible to adopt control actions around the epicenter of the epidemic and consequently reduce the incidence of the disease in the city. This finding emphasizes the need for further research to improve the technology available for the prevention of this disease. © 2008 Barreto et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Software development organizations that have been employing capability maturity models, such as SW-CMM or CMMI for improving their processes are now increasingly interested in the possibility of adopting agile development methods. In the context of project management, what can we say about Scrum's alignment with CMMI? The aim of our paper is to present the mapping between CMMI and the agile method Scrum, showing major gaps between them and identifying how organizations are adopting complementary practices in their projects to make these two approaches more compliant. This is useful for organizations that have a plan-driven process based on the CMMI model and are planning to improve the agility of processes or to help organizations to define a new project management framework based on both CMMI and Scrum practices. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2008.},

abstract={In a competitive business landscape, large organizations such as insurance companies and banks are under high pressure to innovate, improvise and differentiate their products and services while continuing to reduce the time-to market for new product introductions. Generating a single view of the customer is critical from different perspectives of the systems developer over a period of time because of the existence of disconnected systems within an enterprise. Therefore, to increase revenues and cost optimization, it is important build enterprise systems more closely with the business requirements by reusing the existing systems. While building distributed based applications, it is important to take into account the proven processes like Rational Unified Process (RUP) to mitigate the risks and increase the reliability of systems. Experiences in developing applications in Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) with customized RUP have been presented in this paper. RUP is adopted into an onsite-offshore development model along with ISO 9001 and SEI CMM Level 5 standards. This paper provides an RUP approach to achieve increased reliability with higher productivity and lower defect density along with competitiveness through cost effective custom software solutions. Early qualitative software reliability prediction is done using fuzzy expert systems, using which the expected number of defects in the software prior to the experimental testing is obtained. The predicted results are then compared with the practical values obtained during the actual testing procedure. © 2008 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

Advanced planning and scheduling (APS) systems are used as examples, and two case studies for their implementation in the electronics and consumer goods industry are reported to support the propositions. The theories of diffusion of innovation, complementarities, network externalities, and technology structuration are applied to develop the propositions for fit, assimilation, and network effects. Information sharing and industry clockspeed are identified as the moderating factors in the proposed model. The framework has both managerial and research relevance. The research guides managers regarding ways to more fully realize the value of agile applications and forms a basis for future research on the business value of IT applications. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.},

abstract={Service-oriented computing (SOC) suggests that many open, network-accessible services will be available over the Internet for organizations to incorporate into their own processes. Developing new software systems by composing an organization's local services and externally-available web services is conceptually different from system development supported by traditional software engineering lifecycles. Consumer organizations typically have no control over the quality and/or consistency of the external services that they incorporate, thus top-down software development lifecycles are impractical. Software architects and designers will require agile, lightweight processes to evaluate tradeoffs in system design based on the "estimated" responsiveness of external services coupled with known performance of local services. We introduce a model-driven software engineering approach for designing systems (i.e. workflows of web services) under these circumstances and a corresponding simulation-based evaluation tool. © 2008 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={In-depth investigation of the phase-noise behavior of injection-locked oscillators and analog frequency dividers is presented. An analytical formulation has been obtained, which allows a better understanding of the shape of the output phase-noise spectrum of these circuits. The simplicity of this formulation is also helpful for circuit design. Approximate expressions for the corner frequencies of the spectrum are determined, identifying the most influential magnitudes and deriving design criteria. In particular, a technique has been developed to shift the frequency of the first corner of the phase-noise spectrum, up to which the output phase noise follows the input one. The expressions for the corner frequencies can be introduced in either in-house or commercial harmonic-balance software, thus allowing an agile design, as no separate phase-noise analysis is required. The validity of the analytical techniques is verified with the conversion-matrix approach and with measurements using two field-effect-transistor-based circuits: a 4.9-GHz injection-locked oscillator and a frequency divider by 2 with 9.8-GHz input frequency. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Recently, an agile software development technique called extreme programming has caught the attention of practitioners and researchers in the software industry. A core practice of extreme programming is pair programming, where two developers work on the same piece of code. We introduce the problem of assigning pairs of developers to modules so as to maximize the commonality - a measure of the extent to which common developers work on related modules - subject to a load-balancing constraint that is motivated by the need to control the completion time of the project. We consider two variants of this problem. In MCAP n, a developer is teamed up with exactly one other developer to form a pair that works together for the entire duration of the project. In MCAP s, we allow a developer to pair with more than one other developer during the project. This "pair-splitting" version of the problem facilitates knowledge dissemination among developers, but can increase the effort needed for a developer to adjust to the work habits of several partners. The difference between the commonality achieved with and without pair splitting crucially depends on the underlying structure of the problem. For trees, we show that the value of the maximum commonality is the same for both MCAP n and MCAP s. Additionally, we obtain polynomial-time algorithms for both of these variants. For general graphs, both problems MCAP n and MCAP s are shown to be strongly NP-complete. We prove that the maximum commonality for MCAP s is at most 3/2 times the maximum commonality of MCAP n. We also provide polynomial-time algorithms and approximation results for a number of special cases of these problems. © 2008 INFORMS.},

abstract={Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an emerging organisational and technical framework to enable an enterprise to deliver self-describing and platform independent business functionality. Businesses are required to be agile and dynamic and IT managers are being asked to deliver improved functionality while leveraging existing IT investment. Globalisation, tighter economies, business process outsourcing and ever increasing regulatory environments are forcing the large enterprises to transform the way they operate. In this context, SOA promises better alignment of IT with business, seamless integration of business functions and reduced costs of development and the industry is keen to embrace this new architectural style. Realising the opportunity, major enterprise software vendors have released a number of development tools. However, a majority of these are difficult to use and do not deliver the benefits they claim. In this paper, we introduce the SOA approach, present the benefits it offers, discuss some of the frameworks, tools and products offered by major software vendors and provide a general guidance for building and implementing SOA. The objective is to provide enough background information that enterprises wishing to embark on the road to SOA have a better understanding.},

abstract={Most industries and organizations use collections of tools, devices, and applications that are growing in complexity. New tools or applications may be acquired and old tools may become obsolete over time. They are often running on a variety of platforms, have different bandwidth and QoS requirements, and in most cases they cannot be accessed through a single point of entry. Moreover, some tools may require specific configurations done by technical experts. To address these issues, we propose an extensible, reliable, and simple software architecture that can hide the complexity of provisioning the network and running the tools. This paper introduces a service-oriented approach for creating an agile infrastructure to provision devices, applications, and their underlying networks. The Eucalyptus prototype is developed as an empirical application to test this approach. Eucalyptus is built on a set of generic fine-grained Web Services to manage and configure available resources, where new resources can be custom-built or imported from a third party. They can be integrated into Eucalyptus using a set of Web Service-enabled APIs. Our user community consists of architects and industrial designers. Eucalyptus can manage and configure the resources needed by geographically distributed groups of architects who need to collaborate in real time on the design of buildings, in a virtual Participatory Design Studio (PDS). Eucalyptus provides a single point of entry for the architects to access a wide variety of tools: videoconference applications, visualization services, rendering services employing parallel computers, etc. Eucalyptus provides a set of upper layer services for users to provision devices and applications running on high-speed broadband networks, as well as the commercial IP networks. © 2007 IEEE.},

In this paper, we proposed an architecture-based, aspect-oriented methodology of agile software development, which takes expressivity and efficiency as two major concerns of embedded applications; expressivity yields agility, and efficiency meets the constraints of resources. Under the separation of concerns, we differentiate the system into functional aspect and several technical aspects which give supports to the functional one. Different concerns need different programming paradigms. At the functional aspect, we takes declarative programming, and at the technical aspects procedural programming. An abstract machine, as a pivotal of the architecture, weaves all these aspects dynamically at runtime, to achieve all the functionalities of the system. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={We had been developing software with a strict waterfall mentality for several years. Our testing cycle was broken up into distinct phases for functional, system and regression testing. One phase did not start until the previous one was completed. Our testing team had always been a real asset to the organization. The entire team was a highly skilled group of automation testers using traditional, expensive off the shelf automated testing software. As we switched over to agile development using the Scrum framework, we really struggled with how to incorporate our traditional automated testing strategies into the agile world. Is testing in a waterfall project really that different then testing in an agile project? Yss! would uncover an issue that could take significant amount of time to fix and retest. We knew we needed to refine our development process so that we could get new features to market quicker and get customer feedback earlier in the process. We also needed to start testing early in the development process to avoid large re-work efforts before deployment. If we could do this, then we could deliver what our customers really wanted in a more timely fashion and not waste time developing features that they didn't need © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={ABSTRACT Despite their popularity of agile software development methods, there have been very limited studies to match specific theories with particular aspects of agile software development practices. This study intends to provide a theoretical framework by matching three different types of analysis lenses-process management, social factor, project management-to each component of Scrum software development practices. Researchers can also use them to investigate how each component of Scrum is related each other. With three process management lenses (communication, coordination, and control), we first investigate how and where communication and coordination processes between different elements start, and how management teams can control them. In addition, social factor theories (social facilitation, social loafing, and group motivational gain) and theory of complex adaptive system are introduced to explain core practices of and highlight their implications in Scrum. Finally, we present several important issues on how to optimally manage Scrum teams, how to extend Scrum practices to large-scale and global software development, and how to incorporate pair programming practice from XP.},

abstract={Over the past years, the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) have been broadly used for assessing organizational maturity and process capability throughout the world [20]. However, the rapid pace of change in information technology has caused increasing frustration to the heavyweight plans, specifications, and other documentation imposed by contractual inertia and maturity model compliance criteria [4]. In light of that, agile methodologies have been adopted to tackle this challenge. The aim of our paper is to present mapping between CMMI and one of these methodologies, Scrum. It shows how Scrum addresses the Project Management Process Areas of CMMI. This is useful for organizations that have their plan-driven process based on the CMMI model and are planning to improve its processes toward agility or to help organizations to define a new project management framework based on both CMMI and Scrum practices.},

abstract={Agile methods have been adopted by many information systems development (ISD) teams and organizations in recent years. However, while agile method research is growing, many studies lack a strong theoretical and conceptual base. Innovation adoption theories provide new perspectives on analysing agile methods. This paper is based on an exploratory study of the application of innovation theory to agile practices in use, focusing in particular on the later stages of assimilation i.e. acceptance, routinization and infusion. Three case studies were conducted involving agile method projects, using semi-structured interviews. One key finding is that specific needs of the adopting teams may drive the relevant agile practices in use to a deeper level of assimilation. Another key finding indicates the period of agile use does not have a proportional effect on their assimilation stages. Therefore, one needs to be cautious when using time as a measure of agile practice assimilation.},

abstract={SolutionsIQ's Professional Services Division dramatically improved project quality and team productivity through the adoption of Scrum and Agile values, principles, and practices. The organization's original structure was typical of a consulting organization; functional silos (developers, testers, Project Managers) matrixed into project assignments. This model was misaligned with the team-based principals inherent in Scrum and Agile. This misaligned organizational structure created inefficiencies and obstacles (waste) in team and departmental function. In an effort to improve this misalignment, the authors designed and implemented an innovative organizational model based on Type C Scrum. This paper assumes the reader is generally familiar with Agile and Scrum basics, and provides a cursory definition of Type C; an advanced organization-wide extension of the simple Scrum project management wrapper. The paper provides a fairly detailed description of a specific instantiation of Scrum and Agile organizational design in a 400 person services business. © 2007 IEEE.},

The goals of each stakeholder are defined first followed by the choice of appropriate performance indicators. The evaluation of each indicator is based on metric values collected during process execution.

abstract={Agile processes have been introduced to avoid the problems most of software practitioners have run up against by using traditional software development methodologies. These are well known for their benefits like focus on quality, early business value delivery, higher morale of stakeholders, and the reduced cost/schedule. Also, they can support the earlier and quicker production of the code by dividing the product into small segments called iterations. However, there are on-going debates about their flexibility to accommodate changing requirements and whether the productivity and quality of the agile processes is satisfactory for the customers or not. Previously available studies have mostly focused on comparing XP(eXtreme Programming) with some other Agile methodologies, rather than comparing it with traditional plan-driven software development methodologies. In this Paper, we identify the XP phases and practices, how they ensure product quality, and map XP phases against the Spiral model phases to prove that XP has built-in QA (Quality Assurance) practices in its life cycle, in addition to its focus on productivity. A case study is also included to empirically investigate quality of the product developed using XP with comparison to the product developed using Spiral Model. © 2007 IEEE.},

Yet, they are subject to frequent requirements changes in terms of changing business needs and technology, and their market is highly competitive. Moreover, most of these systems are far away from so called agile home ground.

The aim of this research is to analyze and summarize studies on agile practices and techniques and to propose a framework for evaluation of the applicability of a given set of practices. As a first step of the analysis, practices available for each phase of the software development life-cycle are identified. Counting the dependencies and the constraints between them, estimation of practices' compatibility is shown. Secondly, the impact of several external factors, divided in three main categories-social, business and technological, is examined. The results from the analysis help a set of practices to be evaluated against the other according to internal dependencies between practices and particular external factors.},

abstract={Agile Methods have become a hot-spot in contemporary research and practice on software engineering. There are numerous successful and classic cases for applying agile methods. However, software processes must adapt to the characteristics of projects, people and organizations. Since each software project is unique, we can hardly define a series of universal and repeatable processes for all agile projects. A pattern is a general solution to a common problem or issue, one from which a specific solution may be derived. This paper introduces concept of pattern into software process and organizes experience proved to be effective in agile methods as a group of patterns. Based on this group of process patterns, we propose a Process Pattern Language PPL for Agile Methods. Any agile project can find a series of process patterns from PPL according to its characteristics, and generate an appropriate process by following instructions from these patterns. We also give an example of applying this pattern language to generate software processes. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={Agile software development methods focus on the rapid and iterative delivery of a software product in small increments. Over the last decade, the software industry has shown a substantial interest in agile practices but there is no standard guiding vision model or framework to adopt and then use to assess or improve the agile method in a software development organization; indeed, the absence of a guiding vision model could result in the failure of the agile implementation. The purpose of this paper is to present an Agile Adoption and Improvement Model (AAIM) for the adoption, assessment and improvement of an agile software development process. We have analysed the results of several agile software process assessments, industrial case studies on the adoption of an agile approach and feedback from both researchers and the software industry for the construction of the AAIM. The AAIM can be used as a gradual road map for the adoption of an agile approach so that the required agile level can be achieved and improved over a period of time. The AAIM has been organized in three agile blocks, six agile stages (AS) and an embedded agility measurement model (to quantitatively measure the degree of agility). In AAIM, each stage specifies goals that must be achieved to attain a particular business value through the use of an agile software development approach.},

What better opportunity, therefore, to apply agile principles as a means of delivering maximum value to a mass market while embracing chaotic change? Yet the elements that made Yahoo! Music cry out for an agile approach also presented major stumbling blocks - not least the challenge of harnessing teams and technology obtained by serial acquisition, with competing passions, perspectives and technical expertise. Ultimately the team was able to face and overcome these challenges by unifying around an increasingly agile business philosophy that addresses not only software development, but the entire Music organization. In this experience report, the lessons of agile adoption at Yahoo!

However, it has been found that the current traditional phase-based approach towards the development of SOA-based applications, contrarily, lacks agility, which mitigates against the needed ability to quickly respond to changes in business processes. Therefore, here, we suggest an agile approach to implement a flexible SOA.

abstract={The research on teaching and learning over the past 50 years suggests that the early use of collaborative learning leads to higher interest, higher retention, and higher academic performance in students. Early use of these techniques can also increase the sense of belonging for students and can lead to the early development of collaborative skills to prepare students for team experiences in subsequent courses and future careers. During the weekly lab sessions of a second semester introduction to programming course students engaged in collaborative learning experiences through team-based problem solving, project planning, pair programming, and other agile software development practices. Course objectives provided specific goals and criteria for assessment relative to these skills. The assessment in the authors' prior work identified several problem areas which led to specific initiatives to address those problems: (a) instructor-chosen teams, (b) early instruction and reflection on team skills, (c) feedback on team performance, and (d) the use of an IDE that incorporates an automated test-driven development tool. This paper describes the implementation and assessment of these efforts. A significant increase in student team skills from the middle of the semester to the end of the semester was observed.

Transitioning to new methods of development is particularly daunting in a large organization that already has a sizeable existing code base and a broad set of existing customers.

This paper describes our experience in overcoming the barriers to increasing the adoption of Agile practices. Drawing from Agile principles, we have developed an approach for improvement that enables teams to accelerate change, deepen their degree of understanding, and increase their success in execution.

The paper looks at the tension that transpired between the bureaucratic project arena and the Agile development approach. It examines stakeholders' behaviour and attitudes borne from a bureaucratic and hierarchical society that were problematic for Agile development. It further explores the issues of conflict and trust that prevented key stakeholders from building and fostering a collaborative and co-operative collective with the Developers that had significant impact.

A number of product suppliers are investigated via semi-structured phone interviews and company visits. The findings are then compared to the constructs of lean and agile supply chains. The findings highlight that construction supply chains may benefit by adopting agile principles. A number of common supply chain problems experienced by manufacturers in the construction industry are outlined and a number of potential solutions are presented. While this research offers a detailed examination of specific supply chains, further work is required to produce results that can be more readily generalised. A number of areas are identified for further research. The lean manufacturing paradigm has been well explored in a construction context but little research has focused on how the principles of agile manufacturing can be applied. This paper offers guidelines on enabling suppliers to satisfy the construction industry's demand requirements.},

In the introduction section the main agile principles are introduced, as well as the Lean principles upon which the agile methods are built. One of those Lean principles, Muri or overburdening of people, is addressed through the extension of the agile planning process. The extension of the most used agile planning technique (iteration planning) is described in detail, both the motivation for the extension as well as the collaboration practices behind each planning level.

abstract={The interest in pair programming (PP) has increased recently, e.g. by the popularization of agile software development. However, many practicalities of PP are poorly understood. We present experiences of using PP extensively in an industrial project. The fact that the team had a limited number of high-end work-stations forced it in a positive way to quick deployment and rigorous use of PP. The developers liked PP and learned it easily. Initially, the pairs were not rotated frequently but adopting daily, random rotation improved the situation. Frequent rotation seemed to improve knowledge transfer. The driver/navigator roles were switched seldom, but still the partners communicated actively. The navigator rarely spotted defects during coding, but the released code contained almost no defects. Test-driven development and design in pairs possibly decreased defects. The developers considered that PP improved quality and knowledge transfer, and was better suited for complex tasks than for easy tasks. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={Usability has become a critical quality factor in software systems, and it requires the adoption of a human-centered approach to software development. The inclusion of humans and their social context into the issues to consider throughout development deeply influences software development at large. Waterfall approaches are not feasible, since they are based on eliminating uncertainty from software development. On the contrary, the uncertainty of dealing with human beings, and their social or work context, makes necessary the introduction of uncertainty-based approaches into software development. HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) has a long tradition of dealing with such uncertainty during development, but most current software development practices in industry are not rooted in a human-centered approach. This paper revises the current roots of software development practices, illustrating how their limitations in dealing with uncertainty may be tackled with the adoption of well-known HCI practices. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

abstract={One of the principles of the agile development methodology is to "welcome changing requirements even late in development". Refactoring is a major technique used to cope with changes. It enables to reorganize code while preserving the external behavior. Several refactorings can be performed automatically. Aspect oriented programming (AOP) is a powerful technology that greatly improves programmer's ability to quickly introduce changes to a software system. AOP enables easily modifying behavior of numerous locations in the system code or adding new behavior. AOP is perceived by some people not to be mature enough; hence they avoid using it in production software. We have developed ACME, a prototype tool that implements a refactoring process for aspects. ACME enables a developer to convert AspectJ code to pure Java code according to conversion patterns. The available patterns are creating a singleton class from an aspect and merging aspects into existing classes. The tool creates modular and readable object-oriented code. This paper presents ACME functionality using example transformations and discusses the tool's applicability and decisions made during its design. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={Refactoring has been growing in importance with recent software engineering approaches, particularly agile methodologies, which promote continuous improvement of an application's code and design. Web applications are especially suitable for refactoring because of their rapid development and continuous evolution. Refactoring is about applying transformations that preserve program behavior. Code refactorings apply transformations to the source code while model refactorings apply to design models, both with the purpose of increasing internal qualities like maintainability and extensibility. In this paper we propose Web model refactorings as transformations that apply to the design models of a Web application. Particularly, we define refactorings on the navigation and presentation models, and present examples. Since changing these models impacts on what the user perceives, the intent of Web model refactorings is to improve external qualities like usability. They may also help to introduce Web patterns in a Web application. © 2007 IEEE.},

The former are cheap but generic, the latter powerful but expensive. Neither can satisfy both the requirements and budgets of many yards.

abstract={Two international scientific publishers collaborated to develop an Online Submission and Peer Review System (OSPREY) for their journals. Our goals were to meet market demand, increase editorial efficiency and streamline the transition from peer review to publishing. One of the publishers (National Research Council (NRC) Research Press, Canada) had previously purchased a third-party system that was subsequently discontinued by the vendor. Because of this experience and its complex requirements, we decided to build rather than buy a new system. The collaboration with the second publisher, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Publishing, Australia, allowed sharing of resources within a common vision and goals. Agile development through the use of iterations allowed us to continuously add functionality, make improvements and incorporate new requirements. The development team included technical staff as well as stakeholders, future users, business analysts and project managers. The architecture chosen was based on open source technologies, with Java servlets and Java Server Pages for the Web interface. OSPREY currently supports 32 journals at the two publishers. Users accomplish all regular tasks in peer review (submission, selection and invitation of reviewers, submission of review, recommendations and decision) through the software. Editorial staff verifies submissions, sends correspondence and assigns customizable roles and tasks. All tasks are accomplished through a Web browser accessing the application on central servers at the publisher, with no special software or configuration required for any users. Currently, the system integrates with the publishing system by generating manuscript metadata in an XML format, although closer integration with a workflow management system is planned. Since OSPREY implementation, the number of submissions has risen, although marketing and higher ranking of the journals are also factors. For the future, we plan to add new functionality for business tasks and for parsing, tagging and linking of article references.},

abstract={This paper describes a significant revision to the concurrent engineering (CE) methodology that enables a shortened project completion time. Under the CE methodology, sequential tasks can only be performed as such. We introduce a method for starting sequential tasks concurrently using a pre-emptive approach. Where there are a, suitably small, finite number of possible alternative subsequent tasks, we propose that a more agile approach is to begin work on these alternative subsequent tasks concurrently to the preceding task, sharing the resource needed for the subsequent task amongst the different alternatives. Further, where the probability for each alternative task is known, we demonstrate that by setting the resource allocation equal to the probabilities of each outcome, it is possible dynamically allocate resources to minimise the expected completion of the overall project. A simple classically sequential two task case study is developed and analysed to illustrate this method. The paper concludes by revisiting the original assumptions and discussing how resource efficiency is traded off for minimising project completion time.},

The Object Management Group (0MG) has been working on the Software Process Engineering Meta-model (SPEM) in order to provide a uniform object-oriented meta-model for building software process models, like the Rational Unified Process (RUP). Nevertheless, the SPEM neither takes into account flexibility aspects nor provides a flexibility meta model for derived software process models. This paper proposes a flexibility meta-model for building flexible SPEM-based software process models. SPEM compliant PSEEs that implement the proposed meta-model will provide the ability to build flexible software process models, and to associate distinct flexible mechanisms to their corresponding modeling elements.},

abstract={In the IT industry, software maintenance after system delivery is a major concern for any system development team. Software maintenance involves system updates for new customer requirements and error corrections within the delivered software. The management of maintenance is the service management of IT products, the cost of which can account for more than 50% of the total development budget. A major reason for the high cost is the changes brought about by the software updates and error corrections. Inconsistencies in the changes occurring in software development and service management afterwards cause confusion and misunderstanding, leading to further difficulties of maintenance, which enevitably result in further cost increases. To keep the consistency of software products and improve the service management in IT software products, software configuration management(SCM) is an approach. Here, a conceptual framework is set up to introduce relationships between the four areas of SCM and implement mandatory referential integrity between them within the software development stages, then maintain these enforced relationships between stages. It can set up rules to ensure mandatory integrity in changes, retaining consistency and improving Service Management. It is flexible enough to apply with any development models, waterfall, rapid prototyping, spiral development, etc. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={Test-driven learning (TDL) is an approach to teaching computer programming that involves introducing and exploring new concepts through automated unit tests. TDL offers the potential of teaching testing for free, of improving programmer comprehension and ability, and of improving software quality both in terms of design quality and reduced defect density.This paper introduces test-driven learning as a pedagogical tool. It will provide examples of how TDL can be incorporated at multiple levels in computer science and software engineering curriculum for beginning through professional programmers. In addition, the relationships between TDL and test-driven development will be explored.Initial evidence indicates that TDL can improve student comprehension of new concepts while improving their testing skills with no additional instruction time. In addition, by learning to construct programs in a test-driven manner, students are expected to be more likely to develop their own code with a test-driven approach, likely resulting in improved software designs and quality.

This study presents a review and a systematic assembly of existing studies on the tailoring and introduction of RUP. From a systematic search for study reports on this topic we found that most research is anecdotal and focus on the effects of RUP itself. Only a few number of studies address tailoring and introduction. We have found that tailoring RUP is a considerable challenge by itself and that it must be closely related to existing best practices. We see a tendency of turning from large complete process frameworks towards smaller and more light-weight processes which may impose a smoother transition from process model to process in use. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

abstract={One of the problems associated with complex systems engineering is identifying the system knowledge relevant to build system implementation. System operations are an essential part of this knowledge. Software and system engineering standards highlight the importance of system operations; templates for a concept of operations document are available from different standard bodies in the context of requirements engineering and specification. However, specific guidelines for operations modeling are not usually provided. This paper introduces an approach to systematically model system operations. The cornerstone for this is an operations metamodel; this metamodel is presented within this paper and has been defined using UML 2.x. The baseline for the metamodel is a schema, also introduced within the paper, which formalizes system operations in terms of commands acting on systems, inputs to the system, and different kinds of outputs classified into responses, notifications and alarms. Operations models, as presented here, comprise system knowledge essentials from a functional point of view but reduced in size compared to the whole system specification. They can be deployed in several ways; this paper presents their use as drivers for system development and validation from early lifecycle stages. ©2007 IEEE.},

abstract={Transforming the current National Airspace System (NAS) is required due to the spectacular growth of air traffic and the demand for new types of services by users of the system. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is developing and modernizing individual Air Traffic Management (ATM) systems using modern technologies, software development methods and system architectures that would fundamentally change ATM operations. However, transformation of the NAS to achieve System Wide Information Management (SWIM) represents one of the most challenging arenas of Information Technology (IT). The virtues of a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) offer a practical framework for success by transforming the components of the NAS into services that can be reused and combined. Using a SOA enables the transformation of the NAS to be evolutionary, agile and sufficiently flexible to adapt to changing business dynamics. This paper describes the use of a Business (Mission) Driven Development (BDD) methodology in the context of a SOA to address the significant and complex issues of transforming the NAS. Use of a BDD methodology is a key enabler for managing the scope and fidelity of decision making for system and software design. This methodology uses business value to balance the many competing concerns inherent in developing complex systems. Using a BDD methodology enables reusability and flexibility while navigating the roadmap for NAS system-wide information management evolution.},

abstract={Unit testing is essential in the agile context. A unit test case written long ago may uncover an error introduced only recently, at a time at which awareness of the test and the requirement it expresses may have long vanished. Popular unit testing frameworks such as JUNIT may then detect the error at little more cost than the ran of a static program checker (compiler). However, unlike such checkers current unit testing frameworks can only detect the presence of errors, they cannot locate them. With EZUNIT, we present an extension to the JUNIT ECLIPSE plug-in that serves to narrow down error locations, and that marks these locations in the source code in very much the same way syntactic and typing errors are displayed. Because EZUNIT is itself designed as a framework, it can be extended by algorithms further narrowing down error locations. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

Centric composition engines are widely adopted to enact composite services in many Web service composition research projects. Such a centralized architecture, however, results in problem of scalability, message exchange efficiency, autonomy and adaptation. To deal with the problems discussed above, an adaptive agent coordination framework for service composition is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an agent-based framework for web services composition is presented. Next, agent model and agent conversation are proposed. Finally, an algorithm of process partition is introduced and the adaptation of service composition is discussed. Simulation results indicate that this framework can support highly concurrent requests and large volume of data more effectively than traditional architecture, so it is helpful to improve the scalability of composite services. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={We believe that improved systems engineering practice reduces uncertainty in space systems development and speeds the delivery of benefit, both scientific and economic, to the greatest number of people. To further this aim of reducing uncertainty in space system development, we focus on a seemingly simple challenge with profound implications for end-to-end systems engineering: managing the disparate development demands of long-lead hardware and software. The multi-disciplinary issues introduced by blending these distinct design styles are a major source of risk to program schedules and quality. This paper discusses an approach which applies advances in tools and methods for end-to-end systems engineering for delivering a complex space system within cost and schedule. In particular, we address the application of system modeling tools such as the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) and Unified Modeling Language (UML) and their application to produce and manage the development of engineering artifacts. We show how the use of Model Driven Systems Engineering (RUP SE) explicitly addresses risk and reduces integration schedule uncertainty for systems that necessarily incorporate iterative and serial development processes.

abstract={Enterprise2.0 is the use of emergent social software tools to improve knowledge sharing and collaboration within and between firms, their customers and partners. This paper proposes that Enterprise2.0 is a double-edged sword and should be adopted cautiously. Emerging trends in e-business are specialisation and collaboration, creating a diverse population of organisations, each tightly defined by its core competences, interacting in a constant sequence of transient relationships, each motivated by a particular market opportunity. These dynamic business networks depend on the establishment of appropriate platforms and global standards to enable smooth interaction between the service components, in particular, appropriate metadata such as ontologies. The dynamism of such an interconnected yet free-wheeling economy is constrained unless risks relating to investment in a new business relationship are reduced to levels where the risk-reward ratio favours agility rather than inertia. For its advocates, Enterprise2.0 techniques promise to contribute to the evolution of dynamic, agile, collaborative e-commerce. However, its egalitarian and permissive nature creates challenges. Folksonomies allow a more customer-centric view of an organisation's value proposition but may also undermine carefully devised official ontologies. Collaborative filtering may provide a mechanism for mitigating risk but the trust created is dependent upon the perceived credibility of the reviewers. A high profile example of an initiative designed to facilitate dynamic e-commerce which failed due to unsatisfactory classification of its members and the perceived risk of interacting with unknown reputations is examined. Recent academic research and practical applications that address these conflicts are reviewed.},

abstract={Service Oriented Architectures industry aims to deliver agile service infrastructures. In this context, solutions to specify service compositions (mostly BPEL language) and Quality of Service (QoS) of individual services have emerged. However, architects still lack adapted means to specify and implement QoS in service compositions. Typically, they use ad-hoc technical solutions that significantly reduce flexibility and require cost-effective development. Our approach aims to overcome this shortcoming by introducing both a new language and tool for QoS specification and implementation in service compositions. More specifically, our language is a declarative domain-specific language that allows the architect to specify QoS constraints and mechanisms in Web Service orchestrations. Our tool is responsible for the QoS constraints processing and for QoS mechanisms injection into the orchestration. A key property of our approach is to preserve compatibility with existing languages and standards. In this paper, we present our language and tool, as well as an illustrative scenario dealing with multiple QoS concerns. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

abstract={In the near future, the U.S. DoD will activate a newly created Global Information Grid (GIG) providing an agile, robust, interoperable and collaborative communication network. This GIG is viewed as the single most important contributor to combat power and protection [1]. The GIG can be characterized as a globally interconnected, end-toend set of disparate information and processing capabilities available on-demand to warfighters, policymakers and support personnel. Management of the GIG resources and operation will be, of necessity, intrinsic to the architecture and transparent to the user. The development an architecture that is secure against malicious exploitation, data or service denial and data corruption is a principal focus. Introduction of mobile, adhoc network elements having intermittent network connectivity and limited life exacerbates this problem. In this paper we explore the GIG and present an innovative application of Autonomic Agent technology currently in development that has the potential to automate many of the obligatory network management tasks. Additionally, we introduce a GIG Simulation Testbed that, utilizing Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS), is proving useful in simulating GIG operation at the node level for the analysis of agent-based detection and neutralization of network cyber attacks by malicious parties and programs.},

abstract={Processes in the screen business are characterised by their agile nature. First, the industry is constantly changing and recent technologies such as High Definition Television, digital production and new distribution channels are having deep impact on the industry's value chain and processes. Second, processes contain tasks that are highly creative and involve different types of knowledge workers such as producers, animation artists or compositors. With regard to the highly agile nature of the processes in this industry and due to the fact that these processes are characterised by multiple levels of structure and creativity we have developed a framework for flexible process support based on case study findings and a literature review. The construction of the framework has particularly been informed by empirical generalizations on what we refer to as Creativity Intensive Processes. The framework classifies existing approaches to process modelling and support based on different criteria and therefore aims to support the introduction of IT support in creative environments. In this paper we introduce case study findings along with the framework. The application of the framework is a first step to its evaluation since it is used to retrospectively analyse evidence from case studies and literature review.},

Agile methods and continuous refactoring are well-suited for the rapid development of Web applications since they particularly support continuous evolution. However, the purpose of traditional refactorings is to improve internal quality, like maintainability of design and code, rather than usability of the application. We have defined Web model refactorings as transformations on the navigation and presentation models of a Web application. In this paper, we demonstrate how Web model refactorings can improve the usability of a Web application by using a mature quality evaluation approach (WebQEM) to assess the impact of refactoring on some defined attributes of a Web product entity. We present a case study showing how a shopping cart in an e-commerce site can improve its usability by applying Web model refactorings. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

Control systems in general differ from enterprise and office applications, but the demand for efficient tools and practices is very much the same. However, it seems that at least the process industry is lagging somewhat behind in adopting new tools that could facilitate development. In this paper we will advocate automated functionality testing, one of the cornerstone practices in agile methods. There are indeed other areas that need attention during testing too, but functionality is perhaps the one area where automated test execution and reporting have the biggest potential. A test framework inspired by the simple yet very effective xUnit family is outlined. The underlying idea is to separate the test specification from the code by defining test case scenarios on a signal level. This approach is most advantageous for control systems, because it enables us to support a variety of platforms and languages. ©2006 IEEE.},

Where a senior team, by virtue of its experience, can adapt to replace missing XP practices, a junior team reveals the extent to which the XP practices form a whole and are best adopted together. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={Open office environments are critical to the success of Agile projects, but transitioning an organization from traditional cubicles to an open office environment can be difficult and uncomfortable. Our company successfully accomplished this in a stepwise fashion that allowed us to gain acceptance from the developers and management; the end result was an office environment that allows our Agile teams to excel. Part of this transition included an Open Office Experiment where we moved 38 Engineers into an open office environment and studied the impact and implications.

abstract={Ever since agile software development was introduced in the millennium shift, it has become a controversial software engineering topic with practitioners and researchers arguing about the benefits of it. The opinions have been widely divergent, on one side the supporters of the plan-driven predictable Software Process Improvement (SPI) embracing repeatable processes and continuous improvements, and on the other the agile development putting individuals and interactions over process and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation and change response over comprehensive plans. In this article, the agile methodology is examined from the human and cultural points of view. The concept of culture is analysed for deeper understanding of human and cultural dynamics influencing the agile professional culture. Parallels are drawn to success factors identified in recognised management approaches, such as the Effective Technical and Human Implementation of Computer Systems (ETHICS) and Total Quality Management (TQM). The type of organisation, suitable to embrace the agile professional development culture, is identified by examining the success factors observed. The democratic type of organisation in the C.HI.D.DI. (Clan-HIerarchical-Democratic-DIsciplined) typology is proposed to be the most suitable to create and sustain added business value and competitive advantage for agile software development.

abstract={This paper presents an overview of the image-guided surgery toolkit (IGSTK). IGSTK is an open source C++ software library that provides the basic components needed to develop image-guided surgery applications. It is intended for fast prototyping and development of image-guided surgery applications. The toolkit was developed through a collaboration between academic and industry partners. Because IGSTK was designed for safety-critical applications, the development team has adopted lightweight software processes that emphasizes safety and robustness while, at the same time, supporting geographically separated developers. A software process that is philosophically similar to agile software methods was adopted emphasizing iterative, incremental, and test-driven development principles. The guiding principle in the architecture design of IGSTK is patient safety. The IGSTK team implemented a component-based architecture and used state machine software design methodologies to improve the reliability and safety of the components. Every IGSTK component has a well-defined set of features that are governed by state machines. The state machine ensures that the component is always in a valid state and that all state transitions are valid and meaningful. Realizing that the continued success and viability of an open source toolkit depends on a strong user community, the IGSTK team is following several key strategies to build an active user community. These include maintaining a users and developers' mailing list, providing documentation (application programming interface reference document and book), presenting demonstration applications, and delivering tutorial sessions at relevant scientific conferences. © 2007 Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine.},

abstract={As the Army transforms into a more lethal, lighter and agile force, the technologies that support these systems must decrease in size while increasing in intelligence. Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) are one such technology that the Army and DOD will rely on heavily to accomplish these objectives. Conditions for utilization of MEMS by the military are unique. Operational and storage environments for the military are significantly different than those found in the commercial sector. Issues unique to the military include; high G-forces during gun launch, extreme temperature and humidity ranges, extended periods of inactivity (20 years plus) and interaction with explosives and propellants. The military operational environments in which MEMS will be stored or required to function are extreme and far surpass any commercial operating conditions. Security and encryption are a must for all MEMS communication, tracking, or data reporting devices employed by the military. Current and future military applications of MEMS devices include safety and arming devices, fuzing devices, various guidance systems, sensors/detectors, inertial measurement units, tracking devices, radio frequency devices, wireless Radio Frequency Identifications (RFIDs) and network systems, GPS's, radar systems, mobile base systems and information technology. MEMS embedded into these weapons systems will provide the military with new levels of speed, awareness, lethality, and information dissemination. The system capabilities enhanced by MEMS will translate directly into tactical and strategic military advantages. While reliance on MEMS devices has been increasing, limited studies have been performed to assess their reliability and identify failure mechanisms. Accordingly, the US Army Corrosion Office at Picatinny, NJ has initiated the "Storage & Quality Requirements for Military MEMS" as part of their MEMS Reliability Assessment Program to address these issues. The goals of the MEMS Reliability Assessment Program are to: 1) establish the reliability of MEMS devices including the impact of transportation, long term storage, operating environment, packaging & interconnection issues, 2) analyze the compatibility of MEMS devices with energetic and other hazardous materials found in military items, 3) identify failure mechanisms and failure rates, 4) develop accelerated test protocols for assessing the reliability of MEMS, S) develop reliability models for these devices, 6) identify a standardizing body, standard terminology, definitions, and categories for MEMS devices and 7) determine potential test methodologies for assessing these mechanisms. Current ongoing efforts in support of the program include: 1) an assessment of the long-term storage performance and standards requirements, 2) initiation of ESS testing for the identification of failure mechanisms of selected devices, 3) drafting of a joint test protocol for assessment of the corrosion potential of MEMS devices, 4) assessment of applicability of reliability software packages for use with MEMS devices and 5) development of test guidelines for the assessment of MEMS reliability. This program will benefit the MEMS user community by filling the information gap that currently exists for reliability, including: Assessment of the operational environments in which the military MEMS device may be utilized Determining & developing methods to preserve MEMS devices during long term storage before they are designed into products Independent assessment of reliability that cannot be obtained from private industry Establishment of reliability data that will be fed back into development & design to improve MEMS devices Production & design process can be vastly improved increasing yields that will drive costs down With the rapid growth of the MEMS industry and the potential for MEMS utilization in advanced weapon systems, it is crucial to consider the reliability of this emerging technology in the early stages of development.},

abstract={Purpose - This paper aims to provide a practical model usable by organizations to help form agile virtual enterprises. The model helps to integrate a variety of factors, tangible and intangible, strategic and operational, for decision-making purposes. Design/methodology/approach - A comprehensive development of factors is determined from the literature and an analytical network process (ANP) methodology is introduced for decision model development. An illustrative example is presented. Findings - The results provide a robust model that will aid decision makers and agile virtual enterprise brokers form partnerships within these organizational structures. Research limitations/implications - The paper introduces a conceptual model with an illustrative validating example. A practical application and reapplication of the model are required to further validate the model. ANP can require significant managerial input for its application, potentially causing fatigue for decision makers. Practical implications - Practical implications include a partner selection tool and framework for decision makers. The model may be easily tweaked by the elimination or addition of decision factors and their relationships. Originality/value - The paper is useful to practitioners and organizations seeking to manage partnership formation of agile virtual enterprises, an emerging organizational form. This work expands the number of factors and interrelationships among these factors that no other model has explicitly addressed for the agile virtual enterprise formation situation.},

abstract={For modern systems there is growing proof that serial/traditional approaches, such as the traditional waterfall model and model driven architecture, are ineffective and development lifecycles need to be iterative and incremental. In this presentation, we discuss the iterative and incremental approach for software design methodology called Test Driven Design (TDD). The TDD Development Cycle starts with the requirement specification and therefore captures defects much earlier in the development cycle. TDD requires that no production code be written until first a unit test is written. We compare TDD with the traditional methods and describe in detail the TDD method. We cover continuous integration, acceptance testing, system wide testing for each iteration, test frameworks, cost of change, ROI, benefits and limitations of the new Test Driven Design and provide evidence from industry that TDD leads to higher programmer productivity with higher code quality. The future work investigations will extend the reach and effectiveness of TDD by using latest technologies to generate tests from message sequence charts and generating code thru use of a Model Compiler leading to an Advanced Test Driven Design methodology. Further investigations will also look at the concurrency issues by use of LTSA (Labelled Transition Analyzer) technology. © 2007 IEEE.},

Using this aforementioned architecture, enterprise information systems tend to be more flexible and agile to fit into the capricious business environment, and thus, will be easier to be integrated with other additional applications. The purpose of this manuscript is to propose a migrating solution to convert the architecture of the legacy system into SOA with a systematic approach. This proposed methodology is different from other traditional object-oriented approaches, which migrates the system to have a services-oriented focus without incorporating general objected-oriented (OO) or functional oriented feature. In this study, a case study and information capacity theory were employed to verify/ validate that this approach is indeed an effective and a practicable one. Copyright © 2007, IGI Global.},

abstract={Service providers in the telecom industry are required to invest in agile IT infrastructure and to slash their operating costs to remain competitive in the industry. Failure to transform their legacy IT infrastructure can result in their inability to capitalize their investment on the advanced network technology, as they will be unable to launch long-awaited next-generation services quickly, efficiently and cost-effectively. Despite this fact, most of the several providers are hesitant and fearful of application transformation, according to a survey undertaken by Celona Technologies. Several next-generation data migration tools that support faster data migration at lower risk and natively support service-oriented principles and data federation, improving agility, are evolving to solve the problems of service providers in complex data migration. These tools are built using open principles, help service providers protect themselves against inevitable change and re-usable.},

abstract={As the Army transforms into a more lethal, lighter and agile force, the technologies that support these systems must decrease in size while increasing in intelligence. Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) are one such technology that the Army and DOD will rely on heavily to achieve these objectives. The MEMS devices within these systems will be required to last as long as the lifetime of the weapon systems in which they are embedded which may be decades. MEMS devices are also required to function properly after extended periods of inactivity while in storage. Even though the reliance on MEMS devices has been increasing, there have been limited studies performed to determine their reliability and failure mechanisms. Accordingly, the US Army Corrosion Office at Picatinny Arsenal, NJ manages the MEMS Reliability Assessment Program to address this issue. The goals of the MEMS Reliability Assessment Program are to 1) Establish the reliability of MEMS devices including the impact of transportation, long term storage, operating environment, packaging & interconnection issues; 2) Analyze the compatibility of MEMS devices with energetic and other hazardous materials found in military items; 3) Identify failure mechanisms and failure rates; 4) Develop accelerated test protocols for assessing the reliability of MEMS; 5) Develop reliability models for these devices; 6) Identify a standardizing body, standard terminology, definitions, and categories for MEMS devices; 7) Determine potential test methodologies for assessing these mechanisms. Current ongoing efforts in support of the program include: 1) an assessment of the Long-term storage performance and standards requirements, 2) initiation of ESS testing for the identification of failure mechanisms of selected devices, 3) drafting of a joint test protocol for assessment of the corrosion potential of MEMS devices, 4) assessment of applicability of reliability software packages for use with MEMs devices and 5) development of test guidelines and test capabilities for the assessment of MEMS reliability. Recent accomplishments of the program include an assessment of the MEMS & NEMS technologies currently of interest to the Department of Defense, Test Guidelines for Environmental Stress Screening (ESS) of MEMS devices and components, Long-Term Storage Test Guidelines, Assessment of the Barriers to Implementation, and other tools and methodologies to facilitate the transition of MEMS & NEMS to the Department of Defense. The MEMS assessment generated under this program will benefit the MEMS user community by filling the information gap that currently exists for reliability. With the rapid growth of the MEMS industry it is crucial to consider the reliability of this emerging technology and its applications in the early stages of its development.},

abstract={Agile software development methods have become increasingly popular since the late 1990s, and may offer improved outcomes for software development projects when compared to more traditional approaches. However there has previously been little published empirical evidence to either prove or disprove this assertion. A survey carried out in March 2006 gathered responses from a large number of software development professionals who were using many different methods, both traditional and agile. A statistical analysis of this data reveals that agile methods do indeed improve outcomes from software development projects in terms of quality, satisfaction, and productivity, without a significant increase in cost. However, adoption of methods appears to involve a high degree of adaptivity, with many methods being used in combination and sets of techniques being adopted on an ad hoc basis. In this context, our analysis suggests that choosing specific combinations of methods can be particularly beneficial. However, we also find that successful adoption of an agile method is to some extent dependent on rigorous integration of certain core techniques. © 2007 International Federation for Information Processing.},

The survey explored the effectiveness of various practices on agile projects to determine what is actually working in practice. Organizations seem to be more successful with smaller project teams than larger ones, as bigger the team, the harder it is to succeed regardless of the development paradigm, while much of the agile methods have focused on collocated teams. The survey asked about the success rate of agile in various situations, in which 296 respondents showed that they had tried agile techniques when the team was collocated, 251 had tried them without collocation, while 130 had applied them in offshore situations. The survey also validated the agile rhetoric around the importance of working software and source code. High-level architecture and requirements models, as prompted by Agile Model Driven Development (AMDD), also seem to be effective in practice.},

The platform should be capable of uniting global development teams with process and must be capable of providing them with the ability to work locally while they collaborate globally. Agreeing and incorporating common and understood best practices across GDD teams is the best way to establish cohesion on implementation style. A GDD metrics and measurement approach can also benefit procurement of software services.},

abstract={This paper presents a qualitative investigation of learning failures associated with the introduction of a new software development methodology by a project team. This paper illustrates that learning is more than the cognitive process of acquiring a new skill; learning also involves changes in behaviour and even beliefs. Extreme Programming (XP), like other software development methodologies, provides a set of values and guidelines as to how software should be developed. As these new values and guidelines involve behavioural changes, the study investigates the introduction of XP as a new learning experience. Researchers use the concepts of single and double-loop learning to illustrate how social actors learn to perform tasks effectively and to determine the best task to perform. The concept of triple-loop learning explains how this learning process can be ineffective, accordingly it is employed to examine why the introduction of XP was ineffective in the team studied. While XP should ideally foster double-loop learning, triple-loop learning can explain why this does not necessarily occur. Research illustrates how power factors influence learning among groups of individuals; this study focuses on one specific power factor - the power inherent in the desire to conform. The Abilene Paradox describes how groups can make ineffective decisions that are contrary to that which group members personally desire or believe. Ineffective decision-making occurs due to the desire to conform among group members; this was shown as the cause of ineffective learning in the software team studied. This desire to conform originated in how the project team cohered as a group, which was, in turn, influenced by the social values embraced by XP. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The features of open-source software, which has enabled the management of large software projects of globally distributed nature, are presented. The main benefits of open-source software are the ability to hire the right talent for the right job globally, productivity increase from flat and asynchronous Internet-based communication, collaborative problem solving approach, and adoption of more agile and iterative software development models. Open-source companies have extremely flat hierarchies and are very user-driven in strategic discussions such as the product roadmap. However, open-source software has also provided certain benefits to the engineers such as an attractive career, opportunity for global exposure, recognition of one's individual effort in the international market, and gives empowerment, values, and fun for work. Open-source software is creating a source of independent and increased income option for many software engineers.},

abstract={The advancement of web services in the last few years has spurred a number of revolutionary concepts in information technology and management including service-oriented architectures, service-oriented computing, and services science, management and engineering, which can be collectively called as "services computing." Services computing is a new research field that goes beyond traditional computing disciplines as it includes not only architectural, programming, deployment, and other engineering issues, but also management issues such as business component modeling, business process design, and service delivery. In this paper, we provide an overview of emerging research concepts in services computing without attempting to unify them as it will take sometime for the field to become mature. In addition, we take a position that the ultimate goal of services computing is to create the necessary technological and managerial foundation to support enterprise agility. In this short paper, we give an overview of services computing, describe its relationship to enterprise agility, and discuss basic technical and managerial issues. Finally, we introduce the papers that are published in this special issue. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.},

abstract={Non-dedicated loosely coupled systems are popular platforms for cluster- and grid-based parallel processing, fundamentally because they have good cost-performance ratios and are scalable. However, these platforms represent highly dynamic environments in which performance and efficiency can be seriously impacted by changes in environmental conditions. This is especially significant where the run-time configuration has been determined statically, either at compilation time or at the start of execution. This paper introduces the concept of agile parallel processing in which the application manages several aspects of its own run-time behaviour, including deployment granularity. This approach reduces the emphasis on the preconfiguration of components, and relies instead on inbuilt learning and discovery capabilities. To facilitate investigation into the extent to which a self-managing approach can be beneficial to parallel processing, an experimental framework has been developed. The framework provides a range of services such as dynamic worker discovery and performance calibration, and policy-controlled facilities such as resource management and adaptation to suit environmental conditions. The framework integrates these services with the parallel application code. The operation and performance of policy-based dynamic deployment scheduling in dynamic environments is analysed in detail.},

abstract={Introduction of salmonids is a common and widespread practice in rivers and lakes of Patagonia, but their impacts remain poorly understood. We analyse the effect of exotic introduced salmonids (rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss) on the benthic macroinvertebrate community of low order streams. We conducted a field survey in three headwater streams (Challhuaco, Cascada and Pescadero streams) in the northern Andean-Patagonian region (around 41° S and 1500 m above sea level). The streams are canopied by deciduous Nothofagus pumilio forest. On each system, we established fishless and contiguous fish sites separated by waterfalls that limit fish access to upper sections. At each site we determined benthic macroinvertebrate size, taxonomic and functional structure in addition to trout gut contents. In the presence of trout, we observed significant shifts in invertebrate body size towards smaller individuals, thus a decrease in total macroinvertebrate biomass was observed. We found that large taxa (Klapopteryx kuscheli, Tipula sp.) and active swimming species (Metamonius anceps and Hyalella curvispina) were reduced in abundance or were absent in reaches with trout. At the same time, we found that trout positively selected large size classes of invertebrates. As a consequence of species losses, benthic community structure changed drastically in the presence of trout: shredders were the feeding group most affected negatively (-68 %) followed by scrapers. The reduction of shredders may suggest a potential effect on Nothofagus leaf litter breakdown and hence, supply of FPOM to downstream reaches. © 2007 E. Schweizerbart'sche Verlagsbuchhandlung.},

This paper introduces a lightweight approach to security risk mitigation that can be used within an Agile Development framework - the Security Obstacle Mitigation Model (SOMM). The SOMM uses the concept of trust assumptions to derive obstacles and the concept of misuse cases to model the obstacles. A synthetic scenario, based on an on-line system, shows how the SOMM is used to anticipate malicious behaviour with respect to an operational information system and to document a priori how this malicious behaviour should be mitigated. Since the SOMM is conceptually simple in deployment, its use is well within the capacities of the users who form part of an Agile Development team and crucially it should not take up a significant amount of development time. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2007.},

abstract={This paper proposes an adoption model for complex network-based information systems (CNIS) standards which extends current diffusion of innovation theory within a specific technological context, that of ambient intelligence (AmI). The issue of open and closed standards is especially important for networked information systems; however, a range of factors impact the adoption decision and challenge existing models of adoption. Such models are based on DOI theories that have their roots in more simplistic technological innovations. In order to extend the current view on adoption, the adoption context must be closely considered. Agile organizations must constantly survey the external environment to determine the potential of emerging technology. Open standards may make organizations less vulnerable to environmental flux due to uncertainties caused by the lack of transparency of proprietary standards. Accordingly, the proposed model moves toward providing a means to assess factors impacting the adoption of open and proprietary standards. © 2006 International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={Agile software development methods, including Scrum, Extreme Programming (XP), and Dynamic System Development Method (DSDM) have been mainly applied to small-scale and dynamically evolving software development projects (e.g., Internet and Web software development) with some success, due to their lighter and faster development life cycle. However, there has been very limited evidence of the effectiveness of such methods (in particular Scrum) in mission-critical and largescale software development projects. This paper will present the findings of a case study on the applicability and effectiveness of Scrum in such projects. We first briefly summarized the findings on what aspects of Scrum were both successfully and poorly adopted (applicability perspective) and what aspects of Scrum were key factors to improve or deteriorate the quality of the products in terms of bug rates, development time and costs (effectiveness perspective). Based on literature reviews of small group research, we also analyzed the effectiveness of Scrum from the perspectives of social facilitation, social loafing, and group motivational gains. In addition, we identified five core characteristics of Scrum and analyzed the relationships among them. Finally, this paper provides some suggestions to help organizations overcome obstacles expected in adopting the Scrum method as a future development tool.},

However, the biggest challenge the team encountered was not in any of these other areas, but in one that most of the team figured was simple: Testing. This paper describes how difficult it was to actually get the various testing practices in place and functioning properly. In particular, I discuss challenges we faced in coming to a common understanding of the practices, estimating testing effort, allocating the time required to do automated tests in a feature-driven culture, and getting a team of diverse individuals to understand how to apply principles that sound great but are challenging to implement. © 2006 IEEE.},

We have adapted the ROI model to our analysis to assess what affect a chosen development approach has on the outcome of the groups' projects. In our investigation we observed seven software teams as they implemented a business information system. Two groups adopted agile practices, including fortnightly iterative delivery; the other groups were controls. We found that being labelled agile did not necessarily imply that a group's practices were more agile. Also, it was unclear whether the so-called agile groups delivered a better ROI than their plan-driven counterparts. Copyright 2006 ACM.},

abstract={Agile software development practices including XP and Scrum have risen to prominence within the software engineering community over the past ten years. Are agile software development practices converging? Are some practices becoming more integrated and/or more widely adopted than others? In the early 90s there was a convergence of object-oriented design methodologies - is a similar pattern being repeated within the agile software development community? Several years ago conferences featured debates on the number of practices inherent to XP - or for that matter what constituted XP. Is the Agile community on the verge of converging to standardization or do individual practices retain their individually and evangelists/disciples? A somewhat related question is: Can an agile practice be applied out of the box or is some assembly required? What does it take to get agility going in an organization? Does it work as advertised? What practices work and play well with others? Hear the experiences of panelists in their attempts to actually make agile work in the real world. From Crystal, DSDM, FDD, LEAN, Scrum, to XP (and others) - participants will to share their perspectives and experiences. Be warned - this fishbowl will be stocked with piranhas.},

abstract={Acceptance tests are of major importance for the successful roll-out of new software products. Any brilliantly engineered software unable to suit the user's expectations will fail in practice. Tight time-to-market and limited resources makes acceptance testing difficult. This is especially true if multiple locations for development and testing are concerned. We argue that a solution must allow an off-site customer to test the software in question whenever he finds the time to do so. This requires tool support as well as simplicity in design. Within these constraints, we propose on a framework and elaborate on a prototypical software solution that facilitates distributed acceptance testing in Extreme Programming projects. We utilize technologies to allow the deployment over the internet even in strictly organized company networks. We provide further evidence of the feasibility by deploying the software prototype to evaluate the design.},

abstract={"Statically compiled and strongly typed languages (Java, C#) have demonstrated their ability to produce robust, easily maintainable applications." Many of us accept this statement as dogma, not open to question. Whether true or not, most of us would agree that such languages as Java have changed forever the way we develop and deploy applications. In this paper, we propose that in order to evolve the next generation of distributed, rapidly developed applications, lightweight languages (what were once called "scripting languages") such as Python, Ruby, PHP, ECMAScript, Groovy, and JudoScript are critical to provide infrastructure for component-based applications, to support rapid prototyping, and more and more to create next generation applications themselves. Further, we survey features and capabilities of next generation programming languages and discuss techniques for integration of components created in strongly typed languages. Additionally, we focus on distributed applications using dynamic combinations of disparate languages without the need for heavy weight constructs such as CORBA; turning native applications into services; and creating conversational applications. Finally, we review a large-scale systems management application implemented entirely using agile languages and open protocols. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={Most large IT organizations need the best of both worlds - working software that supports ever-changing business needs, and a process for delivering software that is predictable, trainable, and auditable. Organizations with agile software teams often receive timely, cost-effective solutions of sufficient quality. Organizations with formal processes often benefit from industry-recognized certifications and robust process improvement mechanisms. Rarely does a single, large IT organization achieve both. DTE Energy has such a combination: its lightweight yet CMMI-compatible methodology is now used within its 600+ person IT organization to deliver and support working software. Its small teams embrace core agile principles as they provide "just enough" solutions that satisfy maturing business needs. Yet they passed two SCAMPI appraisals toward formal CMMI Level III accreditation, scheduled for mid-2006. This report extends the Agile 2005 experience report on DTE Energy's agile IT organization's journey toward CMMI staged maturity accreditation. This report briefly recaps their seven years of agile experience, presents governance mechanisms and change management techniques, and highlights their four-release, one-year plan for CMMI Level III accreditation. Finally, this report offers suggestions on embracing a formal process framework that are applicable to any organization. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={Agile software development has challenged the traditional ways of delivering software as it provides a very different approach to software development. In recent decades, software process improvement (SPI) has been widely studied in the context of traditional software development, and its strengths and weaknesses have been recognised. As organisations increasingly adopt agile software development methodologies to be used alongside traditional methodologies, new challenges and opportunities for SPI are also emerging. One challenge is that traditional SPI methods often emphasise the continuous improvement of organisational software development processes, whereas the principles of agile software development focus on iterative adaptation and improvement of the activities of individual software development teams to increase effectiveness. The focus of this thesis is twofold. The first goal is to study how agile software development teams can conduct SPI, according to the values, principles and practices of agile software development, in tandem with the success factors of traditional SPI. The second goal is to study how the team-centred SPI of agile software development and the traditional view of organisational improvement can be integrated to co-exist in a mutually-beneficial manner in software development organisations. The main research methodology in this thesis is action research (AR). The empirical data is taken from six agile software development case projects. The results of this research have been published in a total of seven conference, and journal, papers. The principal result of the study of project level SPI is an Iterative Improvement Process which provides systematic, yet agile, SPI mechanisms for agile software development teams. This process iteratively evolved during the series of case projects. The empirical evidence of the project level research demonstrates the ability and willingness of agile software development teams to iteratively improve their daily working practices by making minor and simple, yet effective and visible, improvements during their projects. The research data further indicates the positive effect of iterative team reflection on the satisfaction of project teams, and confirms the need for systematic mechanisms to carry out SPI activities in agile project teams. Furthermore, the data shows that external support for the improvement activities proved to be highly significant for the success of SPI within agile project teams. The study of organizational SPI initially focused on integrating agile software development and continuous improvement of existing organisational practices. Arising from this stage, several changes to traditional SPI activities were suggested in order to establish a mutually-beneficial co-existence between organisational SPI stakeholders and agile software development teams. During the research a framework for deploying agile practices in organisations was developed. In this novel framework, the Iterative Improvement Process provides a mechanism for feedback between the agile software development teams and continuous organisational improvement activities. The research data further indicates that documented and validated knowledge arising from the Iterative Improvement Processes of agile software development teams can be beneficial in other contexts, such as in analysing and establishing future SPI initiatives in software development organisations.

abstract={Agile software development methodologies have since their inception claimed to improve the quality of the software product. The agile practitioners have also claimed that use of the agile approach has greatly improved the quality of their products. However, software quality is a rather complex concept; in fact some have defined the entire discipline of software engineering as the production of quality software. Quality according to ISO 9000 is defined as "the totality of characteristics of an entity that bear on its ability to satisfy stated or implied needs." In the existing agile literature there has not been a comprehensive definition of which characteristics of software quality are improved by the use of agile processes in developing software. In this paper an innovative technique is introduced for evaluating agile methodologies in order to determine which factors of software quality they improve. The technique uses a set of adapted software quality factors as defined by Bertrand Meyer and McCall. © 2006 IEEE.},

Agile methods stress continuous face-to-face communication, whereas communication has been reported as the biggest problem of global software development. One challenge to solve is how to apply agile practices in settings where continuous face-to-face interaction is missing. However, agile methods have been successfully used in distributed projects, indicating that they could benefit global software development. This paper discusses potential benefits and challenges of adopting agile methods in global software development. The literature on real industrial case studies reporting on experiences of using agile methods in distributed projects is still scarce. Therefore we suggest further research on the topic. We present our plans for research in companies using agile methods in their distributed projects. We also intend to test the use of agile principles in globally distributed student projects developing software for industrial clients. © 2006 IEEE.},

We differentiate coordination mechanisms as vertical coordination and horizontal coordination. We argue that vertical coordination and horizontal coordination are positively associated with the success of agile projects. The relationship between vertical coordination and the success of agile project is moderated by project size. Explicit knowledge representation can positively influence vertical coordination. Sharing locus of practices can increase collective identity, both of which can positively influence horizontal coordination.},

abstract={Social loafing refers to the behaviour of individual members of a team who have tendency not to work as hard as they could or should, because social groups provide a degree of anonymity such that individual team members feel that their poor performance will be hidden by the overall output of the team. Agile Software Development philosophy espouses the importance of cohesive project teams, the empowerment of these teams, and the collective ownership of the code produced by the team - social values similar to those of communities of practice. This paper posits that one of the unintended consequences of Agile Software Development is that it may give rise to social loafing, under certain conditions. In order to test this proposition, research was carried out on two software development teams over an eight month period to determine if the values inherent in Agile Software Development could give rise to social loafing The theoretical assumption adopted by the authors was that the project team which fully adopted the agile approach would exhibit a greater tendency for social loafing, in comparison to the other team. The findings of the study indicate, however, that the opposite was the case; accordingly, the study's findings are interpreted to offer an explanation for this apparent paradox.},

It highlights the importance of critical adoption factors to the adoption of an agile method and illustrates the usefulness of a decision support process to determine the viability of an agile method for a specific software project. The paper describes the results of a series of workshops (two carried out in commercial software developement companies, and one with personnel from the British Minsitry of Defence) where the adoption assessment matrix was used to assess the suitability of agile methods in software development projects. A major benefit of the tool is that it guides discussion, concentrating the debate on the critical factors, applied to the individual project. These discussions proved to be as valuable as the output of the tool itself. The results of these workshops show that an argument can be made for the use of and benefit of such a decision support process in industry, in supporting the decision to adopt an agile methodology.},

abstract={An agile modeling methodology for building BSP called Cross Platform BSP Framework (CPBF) will be introduced in this paper. We propose an operating system independent unified cross platform BSP architecture; setup a BSP framework which mainstream embedded operating systems like Linux, WinCE, PalmOS and Symbian can build on. CPBF consists of two parts, they target at boot loader initialization and device drivers respectively. The design methodology and guidelines are discussed in detail, and then illustrated by practical audio codec design on Intel XScale development board for example. This framework can accelerate the BSP development and simplify the maintenance work of a specified processor or SOC platform remarkably. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={Requirements engineering (RE) practices are critical to success during the development of business software. As managers assess RE practices, they apply specific perspectives that determine problems identified and recommendations for improvement. Two perspectives have recently dominated managerial thinking within the software industry, one rooted in software process improvement and the other rooted in agile software development. Underpinning these perspectives are two theories about what constitutes good software practice. In this paper, we explicate these theories in relation to RE and show how they differ in basic assumptions about the nature of requirements, requirements capture, requirements usage, change management, and approach to improvement. The repeat-ability theory holds that good requirements practices are plan-driven and follow generic best practices to arrive at an agreed-upon baseline of software requirements. Response-ability holds that good requirements practices are adaptive and involve close interaction between customers and developers to arrive at satisfactory software solutions. We use case study data from a software firm, TelSoft, to show how the theories lead to different interpretations about why current practices are problematic and how problems are resolved. Relating to the improvement strategy adopted at TelSoft, we demonstrate the superiority, for managers, of negotiating response-ability and repeat-ability concerns when improving RE practices. The paper concludes with a discussion of implications for research and practice.},

The significant benefits being realized through employment of APM within the information systems industry are stated. The characteristics of APM are explored, including: philosophy, organizational attitudes and practices, planning, execution and control and learning. Finally, APM is subjectively assessed as to its potential contribution to the pre-design, design and construction phases. In conclusion, it is assessed that APM offers considerable potential for application in pre-design and design but that there are significant hurdles to its adoption in the actual construction phase. Should these be overcome, APM offers benefits well beyond any individual project.},

abstract={Under today's volatile business environment, companies are reaching the point where they need to be more agile - intelligent, fast, flexible, and responsive to changes. Leveraging supplier-buyer relationship to create an agile supply chain is one of the strategies that can help companies make a successful transition to an agile enterprise. Here we introduce a model that can be used to successfully transform a business: the Agile Supply Chain Transformation Matrix (ASCTM), a tool based on the Quality Function Deployment (QFD), and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). More specifically, we have created a tool that can relate the business changes with the appropriate approaches for supply chain configuration and supplier-buyer relationship establishment and determine the business processes and the infrastructures needed to support agility. This tool is built upon the concepts developed through the Agility Programme at Lehigh University in partnership with company project sponsors and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development.

abstract={Agile methods are becoming increasingly common in application design, with their collaborative customer focus and iterative, test driven approach. Whilst they share many common principles, it is rare for Agile methods to incorporate user-centred design and human factors approaches. Similarly, there are many agile techniques that are well suited to user-centred practices. This paper discusses how the two approaches can be incorporated. It introduces practical techniques such as the use of stories to capture information needs; collaborative planning; visual modelling; rapid, time-boxed iterations; stand-ups and retrospectives. It advocates how using such techniques, useful and usable applications can be developed at greater speed with less business risk.},

abstract={How do we implement Agile? Is Agile a good thing for my organization? What barriers will I have to overcome? All of these are important questions when deciding whether and how to apply Agile Software Development to an organization that is used to working in a different way. To enable a good discussion, the language of that discussion must be established. As Medtronic adopted Agile, we realized how important it was to put effort into the language. We established a framework for that language, organizing our thoughts into three areas: Principles, Practices, and Benefits. When talking with visionaries or evangelists, we speak in terms of principles to understand why Agile is the way it is. With practitioners or pragmatists, we speak in terms of Practices to understand how to do Agile. With skeptics, we speak in terms of benefits to determine whether Agile is a good thing for us. In most cases, an effective conversation needs to address all three perspectives. The framework and language help us determine whether issues are related simply to communication barriers, or are related to the decisions of whether and how to apply Agile to our world. © 2006 IEEE.},

Most projects fail not because of the technical ability of the team, but because project goals, objectives and context have not been taken into account when forming the project plan. Further, most teams new to Agile often lack the basic training required to be successful on their first Agile project. Using a lightweight project initiation framework (an inception deck), combined with an Agile boot camp, teams can drastically improve their project's chances of success. This will both ensure more Agile projects are delivered successfully, and aid Agile's adoption into the greater software community. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={Can Agile approaches be used successfully in large organizations, where traditional methods and high levels of governance are the norm? Although the iterative, agile approaches have been seen to work well in small, flexible organizations, or on smaller projects, they frequently fall foul of the larger organization's need for governance, investment appraisal and control. Formed in 1967, OCLC develops software for use by libraries and their users, museums, and academic institutions. Researchers, students, faculty, scholars, professional librarians and other information seekers use OCLC services to obtain bibliographic, abstract and full-text information. OCLC aims to be the leading global library cooperative. More than 54,000 libraries in 96 countries and territories around the world use OCLC services to locate, acquire, catalog, lend and preserve library materials. This paper examines how TCC, a training and consultancy company from Cheshire, England has worked with OCLC, the Online Computer Library Center based in Dublin, Ohio to incorporate the Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) into a development culture that was deeply-rooted in "traditional" software development methods. Examples from multiple projects illustrate how the adoption of DSDM helped OCLC change its culture and achieve success in software development and deployment. OCLC's TLC dashboard was used to track the effectiveness of the development cycle, and to collect metrics from 2003 to the present. We discuss some of the challenges we faced and the six agile steps to success. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={Background: Agile is an iterative approach to software development that relies on strong collaboration and automation to keep pace with dynamic environments. We have successfully used agile development approaches to create and maintain biomedical software, including software for bioinformatics. This paper reports on a qualitative study of our experiences using these methods. Results: We have found that agile methods are well suited to the exploratory and iterative nature of scientific inquiry. They provide a robust framework for reproducing scientific results and for developing clinical support systems. The agile development approach also provides a model for collaboration between software engineers and researchers. We present our experience using agile methodologies in projects at six different biomedical software development organizations. The organizations include academic, commercial and government development teams, and included both bioinformatics and clinical support applications. We found that agile practices were a match for the needs of our biomedical projects and contributed to the success of our organizations. Conclusion: We found that the agile development approach was a good fit for our organizations, and that these practices should be applicable and valuable to other biomedical software development efforts. Although we found differences in how agile methods were used, we were also able to identify a set of core practices that were common to all of the groups, and that could be a focus for others seeking to adopt these methods. © 2006 Kane et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Agile development is based on teamwork and cross-functional teams, and while forming the agile team, ignoring the existing departmental boundaries is another mistake which will alienate department heads and quickly take their support away. Failing to identify and neglecting the sponsor is another common mistake. Failing to define the roles within the agile team creates confusion within and outside the team which keeps everybody messed up for the time to come. Not to create a project plan before the first two iterations and overdoing the team-room concept.

This paper describes the experiences and lessons learned by two teams who adopted test driven development methodology for software systems developed at TransCanada. The overall success of test driven methodology is contingent upon the following key factors: experienced team champion, well-defined test scope, supportive database environment, repeatable software design pattern, and complementary manual testing.

abstract={Our civilization runs on software, and the role of software and more generally Information Technology (IT) is growing all the time. But complaints on software quality are getting more and more common. Software quality depends on many factors and sometimes also universities are blamed - they do not teach the essential skills, that Software Engineering (SE) education provides too theoretical or old-fashioned courses. Curriculum is a complex emerging system; here are analyzed factors which influence it. The main conclusion is that software is a process and its quality follows from the process quality. Process quality is reached by disciplined practices during the development. Traditionally, software development is based on the predefined path of development phases, which all have their purpose, base practices and outcomes. Opposite to this, there is a trend towards light process oriented software development culture - Agile development. In this approach, team work, active role of the client, and incremental product architecture is important. Software development is highly human oriented sector of industry. Productivity can not be increased - at least not dramatically - by tools and automation. New approaches in software industry are based on higher level of automation and reuse of available software assets. Large scale software development is based on reusable platforms, product families, artifacts developed by component factories, but finally especially in the intelligence of the professionals modifying and further developing the available artifacts. In spite of the improvement in automation in "large scale" software development, the main part of software is still developed in very traditional way - from the scratch based on careful user requirements elicitation, specification, system design and implementation. SE curriculum should correspond to the industry needs, only then can universities produce highly skilled professionals, which can satisfy needs of software industry. Development of curricula is supported also by different standards, frameworks and recommendations developed by different interest groups, but the role of these "global" curricula models in the development of high quality university curricula should not be over-estimated. Different approaches in SE curriculum development are introduced. The experiences of authors provide a path of tested "good practices" towards a new curriculum structure implemented in the organizations of the authors.},

abstract={Our report compares and contrasts the Agile experiences of technical writers from two companies. In both cases, the writers had to integrate themselves into medium-sized Agile development projects. However, the writing teams differed in their approaches during the necessary transition and integration to the Agile methodology. Writers assigned to these Agile projects found themselves adapting to new team dynamics in ways that were quite agile, including creative time-slicing, scaling across multiple teams, and finding ways to save time while focusing on business value. We also found that, even though writers can be uncomfortable while adapting the documentation process to conform to Agile practices, they can rise to the challenges and assist their product teams in becoming more proficient and efficient in an Agile world. For writers to become truly agile, their management must invest in the tools, technologies, and personnel to enable their writers - and overall project team - to succeed. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={I had a unique opportunity to experience and analyze the adoption of agile practices on two projects at a major car rental company which, although sharing many similarities including staff, professed commitment to agile process, architecture, and programming environment, experienced two drastically different outcomes. The first became bogged down and eventually went to production late, over-budget, with fewer features then expected, and was only reluctantly embraced by its user community. The second was ready for its first production milestone after only 9 weeks, was enthusiastically embraced by its users, and went on to become an unqualified success and a model for other software development projects at this company. In this report I will illustrate the similarities between these two projects, highlight the differences, and draw conclusions about the factors critical to the success of agile projects in large corporate environments. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={For too long software has been produced using processes that result in a product that is completed late, over-budget, and below the quality expectations of end users. Over the last 25 years a great many incremental, evolutionary, and iterative software development process models have been introduced with the intention of improving software development; yet a recent study by the Standish Group reported that fewer than 28% of software projects are completed on schedule within budget and with most of the originally required features. We believe that getting the requirements right is the key to building successful and reliable software products. In the requirements process the product features are defined, the users are identified, and the user interactions with the system are designed. In addition, usage profiles are developed and estimates of the anticipated software reliability based on those profiles and on formal models of the system are obtained. Thus, reliability becomes an integral part of the requirement development process rather than an after thought of testing at the end of the development process. Although, defining the requirements may be an iterative process, a complete and correct set of requirements must be completed before starting to build the product. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={Software testing is a fundamental part of system development. As software grows, its test suite becomes larger and its execution time may become a problem to software developers. This is especially the case for agile methodologies, which preach a short develop/test cycle. Moreover, due to the increasing complexity of systems, there is the need to test software in a variety of environments. In this paper, we introduce GridUnit, an extension of the widely adopted JUnit testing framework, able to automatically distribute the execution of software tests on a computational grid with minimum user intervention. Experiments conducted with this solution have showed a speed-up of almost 70x, reducing the duration of the test phase of a synthetic application from 24 hours to less than 30 minutes. The solution does not require any source-code modification, hides the grid complexity from the user and provides a cost-effectiveness improvement to the software testing experience.},

abstract={Data visualization is the process of representing data as pictures to support reasoning about the underlying data. For the interpretation to be as easy as possible, we need to be as close as possible to the original data. As most visualization tools have an internal meta-model, which is different from the one for the presented data, they usually need to duplicate the original data to conform to their meta-model. This leads to an increase in the resources needed, increase which is not always justified. In this work we argue for the need of having an engine that is as close as possible to the data and we present our solution of moving the visualization tool to the data, instead of moving the data to the visualization tool. Our solution also emphasizes the necessity of reusing basic blocks to express complex visualizations and allowing the programmer to script the visualization using his preferred tools, rather than a third party format. As a validation of the expressiveness of our framework, we show how we express several already published visualizations and describe the pros and cons of the approach. © 2006 by the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.},

We analyze data collected on 40 real world projects from a leading software corporation to provide rigorous empirical evidence for the value of code inspections. We find evidence for hitherto unexplored hypothesis that improved understanding gained during code inspection has project management benefit of better test planning and control that could eventually avoid project overruns. We provide a research frame work that takes into account the sequential characteristics of waterfall software development model and the effects of rework generated by verification schemes to answer an important research question on the value of code inspections for project management.},

Developing new software systems by composing an organization's local services and externally-available web services is conceptually different from system development supported by traditional software engineering lifecycles. Consumer organizations typically have no control over the quality and/or consistency of the external services that they incorporate, thus top-down software development lifecycles are impractical. Software architects and designers will require agile, lightweight processes to evaluate tradeoffs in system design based on the "estimated" responsiveness of external services coupled with known performance of local services.

abstract={Group estimation of user stories is an important part of Extreme Programming (XP), used for both planning releases and iterations. Research has shown that although group estimation in many cases is superior to individual estimation, there is still room for improvement. For instance, group estimation performance can be reduced by dominant personalities and anchoring effects. Through the analysis of 101 user story estimates, made by an XP team for release planning, we investigate whether the introduction of the planning poker estimation process improved the estimation ability of the team. The results show that planning poker improved the team's estimation performance in most cases, but that it increased estimation error in the extreme cases. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={With the increasingly complexity about software systems and diversity about devices, it is important to take into account the device and users' preferences in user interface (UI) design. However, there are two requirements needs to be met. Fist, UI should be built quickly. Second, various contexts for UI should be adjusted automatically and immediately. In this paper, the UI design pattern (UIDP) is introduced into the adaptive UI design. The agile and flexible user interface is proposed according as the UIDP Library and intelligent agent. When the user performs normal interaction operations, the intelligent agent captures the various information contained the device information and user preferences to build the corresponding knowledge database. According as the UIDP recognized, the adaptive presentation searches the relative UIDP in UIDPs and executes the adjustment for UI automatically. Finally, the implementation and case are described for the system. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={The construction of embedded biomedical applications is an under explored topic. The status quo is for practitioners to utilize a production process which possesses no specific focus; meanwhile, the marketplace requires highly demanding characteristics from these products. The principal requirement is that most of these products need to be effectively defect free. This demands that the production process be directed towards this objective; and hence the focus of this paper is our initial attempts at designing and implementing such a process. Our new process is developed around transforming a subset of extreme programming from the world of desktop applications into a methodology for this new domain. The paper also discusses our experiences in developing test frameworks to support the domain and our objectives. Finally, the paper provides some pointers on our future plans for tackling the many unresolved issues that still exist in attempting to fully realize and support this new development process. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={IT projects have assumed an important role in nowadays turbulent competitive scenario. Meanwhile, project management has been another important issue for implementing strategies that enable companies to face the menacing competition. This paper intends to identify the main sources of conflicts in IT projects, as well as the most common practices to solve them. This study was performed considering the different stages of development life cycle. There are five macro-strategies used for solving these conflicts: withdrawal, smoothing, forcing, compromise and problem solving. The concept of waterfall model for software developing process was also used. Although this model presents several limitations, it was chosen for this study due to its large adoption in the Brazilian companies' context. This life cycle model presents the following phases: analysis, design, coding, testing, implementation and maintenance.The adopted methodological approach was a survey among IT professionals. The research was performed through self fulfilled questionnaires sent by e-mail or answered in an Internet web site. The answers were evaluated in order to eliminate some problematic cases. The valid answers were analyzed through statistical tools. (c) 2006 PICMET.},

abstract={The turbulent modern business environments require firms to be more flexible and agile. This requires ability to quickly integrate and automate intra and inter-organizational business processes. An agile IT architecture is key to achieving success in this environment. Service oriented architecture and Web services provide means for achieving the business agility; however, significant impediments to wide scale adoption and use of these technologies remain. We will focus on significant challenges in the areas of service identification and design, cataloging and searching for appropriate services, domain specific standardization of service interfaces, matching service functionality with requirements, and service selection based on non functional characteristics. We describe an integrated framework based on standard modeling, design and code generation tools to support development of highly agile application systems. This framework is a result of multi year research effort aimed at developing methodologies and tools for defining business components and Web Services, develop schemes for describing components and services in business terms to allow efficient search of appropriate component/services and an environment for assembling application from reusable components and web services. Specific approaches used to address some of the challenges described above will be discussed.},

Uncertain market direction and speed of adaptation will also favor such agile technologies. RBS idea intrinsically minimizes the processing section dedicated to the regeneration of header, while the bulk of traffic bursts travels transparently without on-board processing. This concept also widely simplifies the terminal characteristics. The related techniques have been studied and simulated in the frame of the ULISS project.

abstract={Ever in search of a silver bullet for automated functional testing for Web Applications, many folks have turned to Selenium. Selenium is an open-source project for in-browser testing, originally developed by ThoughtWorks and now boasting an active community of developers and users. One of Selenium's stated goals is to become the de facto open-source replacement for proprietary tools such as WinRunner. Of particular interest to the agile community is that it offers the possibility of test-first design of web applications, red-green signals for customer acceptance tests, and an automated regression test bed for the web tier. This experience report describes the standard environment for testing with Selenium, as well as modifications we performed to incorporate our script pages into a wiki. It includes lessons we learned about continuous integration, script writing, and using the Selenium Recorder (renamed IDE). We also discuss how long it took to write and maintain the scripts in the iterative development environment, how close we came to covering all of the functional requirements with tests, how often the tests should be (and were) run, and whether additional automated functional testing below the GUI layer was still necessary and/or appropriate. While no silver bullet, Selenium has become a valuable addition to our agile testing toolkit, and is used on the majority of our web application projects. It promises to become even more valuable as it gains widespread adoption and continues to be actively developed. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={Modern software development methods such as Extreme Programming (XP) favor the use of frequently repeated tests, so-called regression tests, to catch new errors when software is updated or tuned, by checking that the software still produces the right results for a reference input. Regression testing is also very valuable for Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) software, as ETL software tends to be very complex and error-prone. However, regression testing of ETL software is currently cumbersome and requires large manual efforts. In this paper, we describe a novel, easy-to-use, and efficient semi-automatic test framework for regression test of ETL software. By automatically analyzing the schema, the tool detects how tables are related, and uses this knowledge, along with optional user specifications, to determine exactly what data warehouse (DW) data should be identical across test ETL runs, leaving out change-prone values such as surrogate keys. The framework also provides tools for quickly detecting and displaying differences between the current ETL results and the reference results. In summary, manual work for test setup is reduced to a minimum, while still ensuring an efficient testing procedure. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

abstract={Web Services (WS) is currently the major implementation of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). It defines a framework for agile and flexible integration among autonomous services based on Internet open standards. However, testing has been a challenge due the dynamic and collaborative nature of WS. This paper introduces an on-going project on a multi-agent based framework to coordinate distributed test agents to generate, plan, execute, monitor and communicate tests on WS. Test agents are classified into different roles which communicate through XML-based agent test protocols. Test Master accepts test cases from Test Generator, generates test plans and distributed them to various test groups. A set of test agents that implement a test plan are organized into a test group, which is coordinated by a Test Coordinator. Test Runners execute the test scripts, collect test results and forwards the results to Test Analyzer for quality and reliability analysis. The status of the test agents are monitored by the Test Monitor. Test agents are dynamically created, deployed and organized. Through the monitoring and coordinating mechanism, the agents can re-adjust the test plan and their behavior at run-time to be adaptive to the changing environment. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={With the recent emergence of agile software development technologies, the software community is awaiting sound, empirical investigation of the impacts of agile practices in a live setting. One means of conducting such research is through industrial case studies. There are a number of influencing factors that contribute to the success of such a case study. In this paper, we describe a case study performed at Sabre Airline Solutions TM evaluating the effects of adopting Extreme Programming (XP) practices with a team that had characteristically plan-driven risk factors. We compare the team's business-related results (productivity and quality) to two published sources of industry averages. Our case study found that the Sabre team yielded above-average post-release quality and average to above-average productivity. We discuss our experience in conducting this case study, including specifics of how data was collected, the rationale behind our process of data collection, and what obstacles were encountered during the case study. We identify four factors that potentially impact the outcome of industrial case studies: availability of data, tool support, cooperative personnel and project status. Recognizing and planning for these factors is essential to conducting industrial case studies. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The model was tuned using data from a real FLOSS project: Apache HTTP Server. To introduce the TDD practice in our FLOSS simulation model, we made some assumptions based on empirical results. The two FLOSS development models (nonTDD and TDD) were compared. The one incorporating the agile practice yields better results in terms of code quality. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Extreme Programming (XP) is an Agile Methodology (AM) which does not require any specific supporting tool for being successfully applied. Despite this starting observation, there are many reasons leading a XP team to adopt Web based tools to support XP practices. For example, such tools could be useful for process and product data collection and analysis or for supporting distributed development. In this article, we describe XPSuite, a tool composed of two parts: XPSwiki, a tool for managing XP projects and XP4IDE, a plug-in for integrating XPSwiki with an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Moreover, we will show how the full Object Oriented implementation provides a powerful support for extracting all data represented in the model that the system implements. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Test-driven development (TDD) is an agile software development strategy that addresses both design and testing. This paper describes a controlled experiment that examines the effects of TDD on internal software design quality. The experiment was conducted with undergraduate students in a software engineering course. Students in three groups completed semester-long programming projects using either an iterative Test-First (TDD), iterative Test-Last, or linear Test-Last approach. Results from this study indicate that TDD can be an effective software design approach improving both code-centric aspects such as object decomposition, test coverage, and external quality, and developer-centric aspects including productivity and confidence. In addition, iterative development approaches that include automated testing demonstrated benefits over a more traditional linear approach with manual tests. This study demonstrates the viability of teaching TDD with minimal effort in the context of a relatively traditional development approach. Potential dangers with TDD are identified regarding programmer motivation and discipline. Pedagogical implications and instructional techniques which may foster TDD adoption will also be referenced. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={Research on knowledge management (KM) readiness has matured. However, recent organizational structures have emerged which prevent traditional instruments from adequately measuring KM readiness in an organization. For example, service-oriented enterprise (SOE) structure and agile software development techniques are characterized by multiple groups working together with each performing "services" as part of project pattern or process. Each group acts in its own role as a sub-organization with its unique helping patterns and cultures [17]. Traditional instruments which measure aggregate constructs across the entire organization will miss important between-group differences in an SOE that might influence KM readiness. This paper presents a case-based field-study from a large Fortune 500 financial firm transitioning its structure to SOE and considering agile software development methodologies. Survey data was collected along with a series of interviews with key managers and developers. Findings indicate statistically significant differences in KM readiness between groups and the need for alignment. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={The rapid expansion of the COTS domain causes a "snowball" effect to the growth of information about and used by components. One of the proofed methods to organize information is taxonomies. Although there exist many upper and domain-specific taxonomies, the need to create or extend a taxonomy often arises. However, the effort needed for the construction of a successful COTS taxonomy could be an obstacle because it requires expertise and skills different to the ones needed for COTS development. This and many other problems can drive COTS developers to abandon the taxonomies. This paper proposes an agile approach for COTS taxonomies development based on our work in the MERCED project. The method introduces work separation and step-by-step development in the process of taxonomy construction. First the approach allows a quick start using a high-level taxonomy, created without spending too much effort for its development. Then, in parallel with taxonomy use, the approach allows its extension using dynamic decision models. These dynamic decision models simplify not only the taxonomy development, but also many other activities as quality control, documentation and configuration control. In this paper we also present a real-world example showing how the method operates within the domain of real-time embedded software components. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={Object-Oriented Methods, Formal Specification Languages, Component-Based Software Production... This is just a very short list of technologies proposed to solve a very old and, at the same time, very well-known problem: how to produce software of quality. Programming has been the key task during the last 40 years, and the results have not been successful yet. This work will explore the need of facing a sound software production process from a different perspective: the non-programming perspective, where by non-programming we mainly mean modeling. Instead of talking about Extreme Programming, we will introduce a Extreme Non-Programming (Extreme Modeling-Oriented) approach. We will base our ideas on the intensive work done during the last years, oriented to the objective of generating code from a higher-level system specification, normally represented as a Conceptual Schema. Nowadays, though, the hip around MDA has given a new push to these strategies. New methods propose sound model transformations which cover all the different steps of a sound software production process from an Information Systems Engineering point of view. This must include Organizational Modeling, Requirements Engineering, Conceptual Modeling and Model-Based Code Generation techniques. In this context, it seems that the time of Model Transformation Technologies is finally here... © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

abstract={After a short introduction to the concepts of knowware, knowware engineering and knowledge middleware, this paper proposes to study the software/knowware co-engineering. Different from the traditional software engineering process, it is a mixed process involving both software engineering and knowware engineering issues. The technical subtleties of such a mixed process are discussed and guidelines of building models for it are proposed. It involves three parallel lines of developing system components of different types. The key issues of this process are how to guarantee the correctness and appropriateness of system composition and decomposition. The ladder principle, which is a modification of the waterfall model, and the tower principle, which is a modification of the fountain model, are proposed. We also studied the possibility of equipping the co-engineering process with a formal semantics. The core problem of establishing such a theory is to give a formal semantics to an open knowledge source. We have found a suitable tool for this purpose. That is the co-algebra. We also try to give a preliminary delineation of a co-algebraic semantics for a typical example of open knowledge source - the knowledge distributed on the World Wide Web. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

These methods have evolved a set of shared component techniques. In this paper we show how these techniques can be combined in countless ways to create needs-specific methods in an agile way. We demonstrate the generality of these techniques by describing a new architecture improvement method called APTIA (Analytic Principles and Tools for the Improvement of Architectures).

abstract={The relationship between healthcare providers and the software industry is evolving. In many cases, industry's traditional, market-driven model is failing to meet the increasingly sophisticated and appropriately individualized needs of providers. Advances in both technology infrastructure and development methodologies have set the stage for the transition from a vendor-driven to a more user-driven process of solution engineering. To make this transition, providers must take an active role in the development process and vendors must provide flexible frameworks on which to build. Only then can the provider/vendor relationship mature from a purchaser/supplier to a codesigner/partner model, where true insight and innovation can occur.

abstract={The Unattended Ground Sensor (UGS) Community includes many programs slated to incorporate the JTRS Cluster 5 Transceiver into the baseline systems. However, due to a variety of technical challenges, it's unclear that the Cluster 5 Transceiver will be available in time to support requirements for near-term fieldings. As a result, program offices are beginning to investigate interim solutions for Software Defined Radios (SDR) capable of providing Cluster 5-like flexibility and performance. During the last 15 months, Nova Engineering has been developing the Core Transceiver, a unique multi-band, multi-rate, Software Defined Radio. The Core Transceiver operates in four bands (225-400 MHz, 560-698 MHz, 1350-1390 MHz, and 1755-1850 MHz) and is frequency-agile across these multiple bands, thereby providing maximum flexibility in frequency planning. The transceiver supports adaptable data rates from 100 kbps to more than 1 Mbps, enabling the device to satisfy requirements for sensor-to-sensor communications, as well as gateway links. This transceiver utilizes an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex (OFDM) waveform for robust operation in ground-to-ground multipath environments. The Core Transceiver is compact in size (6.5" × 2.85" × 0.8") and designed for energy-constrained applications. This paper introduces the Core Transceiver requirements, design concept, and implementation, and outlines a strategy for applying this transceiver within the UGS Community.},

abstract={TXL is a special-purpose programming language designed for creating, manipulating and rapidly prototyping language descriptions, tools and applications. TXL is designed to allow explicit programmer control over the interpretation, application, order and backtracking of both parsing and rewriting rules. Using first order functional programming at the higher level and term rewriting at the lower level, TXL provides for flexible programming of traversals, guards, scope of application and parameterized context. This flexibility has allowed TXL users to express and experiment with both new ideas in parsing, such as robust, island and agile parsing, and new paradigms in rewriting, such as XML mark-up, rewriting strategies and contextualized rules, without any change to TXL itself. This paper outlines the history, evolution and concepts of TXL with emphasis on its distinctive style and philosophy, and gives examples of its use in expressing and applying recent new paradigms in language processing. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Most projects for public organizations have adopted waterfall model in software development lifecycle, however, various projects have recently tried to apply an iterative model to minimize risks and to enhance quality of software, But empirical results of software-intensive development based on the RUP are not well known. Therefore, this paper presents process, period, effort and quality factors for a software-intensive system development through the study on the Korean Core Instrumentation System (K-CIS) which has adopted the RUP. We also present the result of comparison between the K-CIS RUP and waterfall model, and lessons learned from the K-CIS case.

This perspective contrasts with the production focused view of software development. That is, interaction becomes the central activity, not a side-effect of a method's prescription. Understanding the principles and components of organizational behavior for inclusion in software process models improves the level of fidelity and credibility of existing process simulations. Furthermore, there are strong connections between the neo-information processing view of organizations and agile software development.

abstract={Purpose : With the emergence of the concepts of lean, agile and leagile paradigms for supply chains, organizations have little idea as to which model suits them based on the their supply chain's ability to counter risks and take on the challenges of the fast changing customer preferences. This paper aims to map supply chains on these two dimensions. Design/methodology/approach : A model is proposed by which suitable supply chain strategy can be selected based on customer sensitivity and risk alleviation competency dimension. Graph theoretic approach is applied to quantify these dimensions for three case supply chains. Findings : The proposed model was tested for three Indian SMEs clusters and suitable supply chain strategy was suggested. Research limitations/implications : It is recommended that the model be tested for those supply chains which have established themselves as lean, agile or leagile entities. Practical implications : Suggested model would help organizations to select suitable supply chain strategy based on customer sensitivity and risk alleviation competency and the transition required in tune with the market requirements in which they operate. Also the areas which need improvements from the perspective of risk alleviation competency or customer sensitivity can be easily delineated. Originality/value : Mapping supply chains based on quantification of customer sensitivity and risk alleviation competency dimension is a novel effort in the area of supply chain management. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Inexperienced teams unfamiliar with XP can face difficulties in adopting at once all twelve XP practices in a "big bang" implementation strategy. Intuitively, a step-by-step approach might seem more practical; however, XP practices are heavily intertwined and mutually dependent, creating problems in terms of prioritizing and justifying one instructional sequence over another. We propose a way to technically analyze the complex interrelationships between XP practices by identifying cluster patterns. These patterns can then be used to assist us in sequencing the introduction XP practices, helping both inexperienced teams and classroom learners in using XP. This work has value in both industrial and educational contexts. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

abstract={A book named called Skills for Managing Rapidly Changing IT Projects has presented several emerging agile methodologies and techniques that allow the management of rapidly changing IT projects. The techniques can replace the technique of pair programming and provides similar advantages. The latest techniques are needed to merge the needs of controlled and defined environments with the agile methodologies. Several structural metric can be profitably adopted without any validation by referring to general values. The knowledge of management process and the adoption of the agile methodologies can be useful in managing the rapidly IT projects.},

abstract={A variety of life cycle models for software development are generally available. Many of the variations were composed to overcome problems in the classic waterfall model. However, it is generally difficult to compare and contrast the methods and very little literature is available to guide developers and managers in making choices. Moreover, in order to make informed decisions, developers require access to real data that compares the different models and the results associated with the adoption of each model. An experiment in which 15 software teams developed comparable software products, using four different development approaches (V-model, incremental model, evolutionary model, and extreme programming), is described. Extensive measurements were taken to assess the time, quality, size, and development efficiency of each product. The experimental data collected and the conclusions related to the choice of method, its impact on the project and the quality of the results, are presented.},

Many traditional IT professionals are struggling to see how they fit into an agile software development project. Some people have the attitude that agilist have adopted techniques such as test driven development (TDD), acceptance testing, pair programming code refactoring, and database refactoring, all of which promote creation of high quality work products. The agile software development lifecycle (SDLC) looks very much like traditional SDLC, but the the former is highly collaborative, iterative, and incremental, and the roles that people take are more robust than on traditional projects. On an agile project, developers work closely with their stakeholders to understand their needs, to implement and test their solution, and the solution is shown to their stakeholders for quick feedback.},

abstract={It is time for a change in mindset in how nurses operationalize system implementations and manage projects. Computers and systems have evolved over time from unwieldy mysterious machines of the past to ubiquitous computer use in every aspect of daily lives and work sites. Yet, disconcertingly, the process used to implement these systems has not evolved. Technology implementation does not need to be a struggle. It is time to adapt traditional plandriven implementation methods to incorporate agile techniques. Agility is a concept borrowed from software development and is presented here because it encourages flexibility, adaptation, and continuous learning as part of the implementation process. Agility values communication and harnesses change to an advantage, which facilitates the natural evolution of an adaptable implementation process. Specific examples of agility in an implementation are described, and plan-driven implementation stages are adapted to incorporate relevant agile techniques. This comparison demonstrates how an agile approach enhances traditional implementation techniques to meet the demands of today's complex healthcare environments. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.},

abstract={Determining fine-scale genetic diversity and structure is critical for the conservation and management of populations, especially those under heavy anthropogenic influence. We analyzed 446 individuals at nine microsatellite loci to determine the local population structure of naturally produced steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss and genetic differentiation from introduced hatchery strain steelhead in the Klickitat River of the Pacific Northwest. We detected significant genetic structure among steelhead in various tributaries to the Klickitat River; the most divergent population was located above a waterfall that acts as a partial upstream migration barrier (average pairwise F ST = 0.13; P &lt; 0.0001). Analysis of mixtures indicated an estimate of six to seven genetically distinct populations of naturally reproducing steelhead in this river system. The hatchery strain appears to remain genetically distinguishable from native stocks (average pairwise FST of 0.078 with P &lt; 0.0001), as only 4.0% of naturally produced steelhead had their most likely assignment to the hatchery strain. These results indicate that the genetic integrity and variation of native Klickitat River steelhead have been maintained despite repeated hatchery introductions and that the potential is high for restoring this threatened population. Further, this study suggests that hierarchical analyses of mixtures to identify distinct populations in a watershed are a valuable method for directing management of reproductively isolated populations. © Copyright by the American Fisheries Society 2006.},

abstract={Two general processes may influence gene flow among populations. One involves divergent selection, wherein the maladaptation of immigrants and hybrids impedes gene flow between ecological environments (i.e. ecological speciation). The other involves geographic features that limit dispersal. We determined the relative influence of these two processes in natural populations of Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata). If selection is important, gene flow should be reduced between different selective environments. If geography is important, gene flow should be impeded by geographic distance and physical barriers. We examined how genetic divergence, long-term gene flow, and contemporary dispersal within a watershed were influenced by waterfalls, geographic distance, predation, and habitat features. We found that waterfalls and geographic distance increased genetic divergence and reduced dispersal and long-term gene flow. Differences in predation or habitat features did not influence genetic divergence or gene flow. In contrast, differences in predation did appear to reduce contemporary dispersal. We suggest that the standard predictions of ecological speciation may be heavily nuanced by the mating behaviour and life history strategies of guppies. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The use of electronics is relatively new to the off-road machine business. As a result many product ideas are being valuated through a trial and error and continuous improvement process. Software will play an important enabler for these product definitions. This is even more true as the off-road industry begins to adopt the open interoperability standard ISOBUS (ISO 11783). A comparison between the world wide trend for software processes, the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and what type of process would fit the off-road industry is based around the maturity of the new product ideas. The strong supply chain link between dealers and customers for off-road machines coupled with the emerging awareness of electronic functions and controls sets a basis for a specialized software development process. An important enabler for this 'agile' process is the re-use of code and incremental testing with reviews.},

With growing adoption of Agile Methods, project managers increasingly need to understand the applicability to their projects and factors that drive key project performance characteristics. While some organizations affirm that Agile Methods solve all their problems, few have shown consistent success over a range of typical software projects. Agile Methods have advantages, especially in accommodating change due to volatile requirements. However, they also present concomitant risks with managing the many dependent pieces of work distributed across a large project. Use of Agile Methods therefore presents a set of tradeoffs. This paper examines the impact of Agile Methods on the people involved in a project, the process under which a project is developed, and on the project itself in an attempt to allow project managers to evaluate the applicability using an agile method. © 2005 IEEE.},

abstract={Most significant software processes involve a wide range of disciplines, from programming to testing, and from documentation to database development. Unfortunately, agile processes are typically presented from the point of view of programmers, with the other disciplines often left feeling excluded and disenfranchised. One such discipline is that of user experience design (often abbreviated UED), a discipline encompassing several key specialties including user research, interface design, visual design and usability testing. UED activities span the full lifecycle of product development from early requirements analysis to construction and testing, spanning both large scale system issues and detailed components, with its work products forming key inputs and deliverables of many development activities. In this experience report, I discuss my coaching experiences integrating sophisticated UED practices into the agile process initiatives of several organizations. My background is initially that of a programmer and later that of an agile process coach, and I'll explore my journey understanding UED practices and how they map to popular agile processes, mainly Scrum [1] and Extreme Programming [2], I'll chronicle the teams' struggles to come to grips with the often programming-centric orientation of agile processes, and their ongoing efforts to integrate their UED best practices into the incremental, collaborative world of agile processes. © 2005 IEEE.},

Schneider's approach was pragmatic in the sense that it took its current three release a year waterfall process and made changes in an incremental fashion. The steps included getting organizational buyoff for the pilot, forming the pilot team, breaking up a release into three 6-week iterations, constructing an open pod area for the group, integrating a offshore (on-site and remote site) element comprising 50% of the 25 person project team, and as of late introducing an offshore testing team strategy.

abstract={Throughout the last three decades many processes, tools, and methods have been used to structure and bring some order into software development processes. One of the most widely understood traditional methods is the waterfall life cycle model. Recently, agile development methods have emerged to overcome some of the process and product-related problems associated with traditional models. They are believed to be lightweight, people focused, adaptive and allow knowledge transfer. Researchers in the area of knowledge management claimed that the knowledge creation process software developers build towards a specific mode will lead to its adoption. This paper attempts to integrate knowledge creation as a condition of adoption. This paper reports on how a Canadian organization shifts its development method from the waterfall process to Extreme Programming model. The findings show that the differences outweigh the similarities and caution needs to be exercised in adopting either one of two models. Knowledge creation, indeed, plays an important role in adopting Extreme Programming model. The implications of these findings for both researchers and practitioners are discussed.},

The SEI-CMM, software process improvement initiatives, and software metrics programs are some of the hallmarks of this school of thought. The more recent trend towards agile development places the emphasis on constantly adapting to a project's changing goals rather than on detailed upfront planning. The majority of reports from pracitioners of agile development are positive and confirm the advantages of this approach. However, moving from a plan driven culture to agile development is not easy. Making the transition requires changes to many established practices and may even touch core values held by stakeholders. Areas affected are requirements and change management, user involvement, willingness to take on responsibility, contract management, and the ability to live with many uncertainties. This talk looks at what it takes to make the transition and presents lessons learned from organizations and projects which have successfully completed the switch to agile development.},

abstract={The Capability Maturity Model (CMM) is a framework for judging the maturity of the software processes of an organization. This model is often misapplied in practice, being used as a bulwark for rigid approaches to software development. This usually leads to project failure when requirements are set in a rapidly changing environment, or when they are vaguely defined. Agile methodologies behave very well in this kind of environment. In this article we show that Agile methodologies can be applied in a CMM context, specifying how every goal of each Key Process Area of the model can be fulfilled when an Agile methodology such as Xp@Scrum is being used. We also show some metrics from pilote projects at a Motorola Software Centre backing our aiming, and showing the benefits introduced by Agile approaches to software development. © Copyright 2010 IEEE - All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Like many software companies, Microsoft has been doing distributed application development for many years. However, recent changes in the market have altered the rules, both in terms of customer expectations and programming models for ubiquitous interconnected smart devices. These changes have provoked two dramatic shifts in the way we develop software. The first is the creation and use of the .NET Framework as a simple, secure, and robust platform for device-independent software development, data manipulation, and communications. The second is an agile yet highly disciplined approach to designing, testing, implementing, and verifying our software which presumes all bugs are unacceptable and must be found and fixed early before they impact internal groups, external partners, and eventually our customers. This paper discusses the nature and impact of these two dramatic shifts to the development practices at Microsoft. Copyright 2005 ACM.},

abstract={Agile practitioners pride themselves on highly productive, responsive, low ceremony, lightweight, tacit knowledge processes with little waste, adaptive planning and frequent iterative delivery of value. It is often assumed that CMMI compliant processes need to be heavyweight, bureaucratic, slow moving, high ceremony and plan driven. Agile developers often skeptically perceive formal process improvement initiatives as management generated inefficiency that gets in the way of productivity. At Microsoft, we've adopted the teachings of W. Edwards Deming and stretched our MSF for Agile Software Development method to fit the requirements for CMMI Level 3. The resultant MSF for CMMI Process Improvement is a highly iterative, adaptive planning method, light on documentation, and heavily automated through tooling. It enables management and organization of software engineering through use of agile metrics such as velocity and cumulative flow but with an added dimension of an understanding of variation - adapted from Deming's teachings. This is the story of how mixing Deming with Agile produced a lightweight CMMI solution for .Net developers everywhere. © 2005 IEEE.},

Traditional estimation methods define an effort prediction model based on data gathered from effort in previous relatively similar projects. These methods have been successfully used for years in many projects developed using traditional, front loaded, high ceremony methodologies, but they are less used, or not used at all, in projects developed using agile, lightweight methodologies. In this paper, we introduce a software effort estimation method that works well in the context of agile development and present preliminary results from applying this method in practice.},

abstract={Agile software development methodologies have been receiving a lot of attention in recent times. Although doubts have been cast on the efficacy of these methods for very large projects, some of the techniques and practices they advocate are very appealing and are being seriously considered by many organizations. It is our contention that many of these practices are antithetical to the orthodoxy of prevailing software approaches. In particular, nontrivial reconfigurations of organizational form, management practices, and workflows have to be undergone to successfully integrate agile principles into existing software development practices. This paper draws on the organizational change management literature to argue that the nature of change involved is resonant of the efforts to introduce Business Process Reengineering (BPR) in organizations. The magnitude of the change as well as the implications of migrating to agile methodologies is also presented.},

abstract={Currently, software development organizations are increasingly interested in adopting agile processes and practices. The organizations, however, need procedures and methods for supporting a systematic selection and deployment of new agile practices and for tailoring them to suit the organizational context. In this paper, an agile deployment framework is proposed. It is compatible with the ideology of continuous improvement of organizational practices (QIP), while it also integrates it with the opportunities provided by short iterations of agile process model. The suggested framework includes the procedures and methods needed for selecting suitable new agile practices in an organization. It also embodies the means for iteratively tailoring and validating the deployed practices within agile projects and gaining feedback rapidly from projects to the organization. The paper presents the empirical experiences of a case study where the F-Secure Corporation deployed a new agile software development process (Mobile-D) in a pilot project in order to utilize its experiences in developing an organization specific agile process model alongside their traditional F-Secure product realization process. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

abstract={Applied research is, by necessity, a distributed, collaborative process. To be useful, research methodologies must not only be applicable in such an environment, but must also be adaptive to the needs of human resources and specific research area requirements. This paper introduces eXtreme Researching (XR), an adaptation of eXtreme Programming (XP) by Ericsson, to support distributed telecommunications research and development. XR builds on XP and tailors it to meet the needs of applied industrial research. It adopts and extends the most useful elements of XP: collective ownership, planning game, continuous integration and metaphor and shows how they are applicable in multi-site, research projects. XPWeb is developed as a tool to facilitate XR in a distributed research environment. XPWeb and XR are actively used by Ericsson Applied Research and have been shown to significantly increase output and efficiencies in multi disciplinary research projects.

abstract={Doing agile development in a relatively inelastic environment, where policies and procedures are virtually unchangeable, creates an impedance mismatch between the agile team and its host organization. Our experience on a variety of embedded Java projects has shed some light on the costs of complying (or failing to comply), where we trialed everything from "refusal to comply" to "full compliance". Regardless of approach, there was always an associated cost, whether in redrafting documents, reducing functionality, spending time in meetings, losing focus on deliverables, or deteriorating morale. In keeping with the Agile philosophy, when our efforts were failing, we refactored our approach to managing the project in an effort to minimize the costs of compliance without adopting more risk to ensure success. In the end we were faced with the questions "How did we fare in the end? Which costs were worth bearing? Was it all worth it?" © 2005 IEEE.},

abstract={The increasing complexity of business systems, the accelerating pace of technological change, and the highly competitive business environment are overwhelming software development methodologies that have stayed essentially the same for the last fifty years. Model Driven Architecture (MDA) is a current initiative by the Object Management Group that represents a major evolution in the way software is developed. There is growing consensus by the information systems community on the fundamental principals of MDA, but some critical elements are missing in the areas of transformation and system-behavior modeling. Agreement on standards and approaches in these areas will take some time, and substantial work remains before MDA can replace traditional, long-practiced methods and be considered a routine approach to software development. When this happens it has the potential to significantly improve the integration of customers into the software development lifecycle. Traditional development methodologies and the newer agile methods strive to overcome quality and delivery problems by emphasizing customer involvement and by attempting to move system validation activities (e.g. those concerned with confirming that the system will meet the customer's needs) earlier in the development lifecycle. The adoption of an MDA approach will not change the role of customers in the development process or the nature of their activities; it will not change what customers do. However, it can significantly change when customers validate a system's functionality. This paper will investigate these issues through a qualitative study using an interpretivist epistemology, and will form generalized conclusions about MDA. © 2005 EDSIG.},

We explored several merits and demerits of this incorporation based on our experiences and observations which are supported by other researchers. In this study we considered those courses of computer science that involve the processes of software development and analysis. It has been found that XP in fitll practice is vulnerable against a single course of software engineering, so some of its practices should be incorporated in the first semester of computer science curriculum and rest should be incorporated in later years. We start our work from the introductory course in computer science where we first implement the concept of pair programming and then implement other practices. Some suggestions are included in this work that will be helpful in implementing this methodology.},

abstract={The Rational Unified Process (RUP) is a comprehensive software development process framework emphasizing use-cases, architecture focus and an iterative approach. RUP is widely known and many organizations have tried to adopt it. Being a framework, RUP has to, in some way, be tailored to the specific context of use, no software development project is alike. This paper presents a case study of a Norwegian SME that tried to adopt RUP in the simplest way, by introducing the methodology by providing comprehensive documentation and some simple training. Our study shows that the use of RUP had some positive effects but also that the use has been scattered. Interviews with users of RUP show that there is a great need of better training and practical support in getting most value out of RUP. The key message is that if you consider taking RUP into use you have to invest resources in it. Training and support are key success factors. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

In this paper, we discuss a testing method for integration testing that exploits formal specification of software architecture of a system. More specifically, our integration testing method implements the separation of concerns strategy to handle both the intrinsic complexity associated with the front-end software development, software architecture, and the difficulty and cost associated with the back-end development, software testing.},

abstract={A goal of evidence-based software engineering is to provide a means by which industry practitioners can make rational decisions about technology adoption. When a technology is mature enough for potential widespread use, practitioners find empirical evidence most compelling when the study has taken place in a live, industrial situation in an environment comparable to their own. However, empirical software engineering is in need of guidelines and standards to direct industrial case studies so that the results of this research are valuable and can be combined into an evidentiary base. In this paper, we present a high-level view of a measurement framework that has been used with multiple agile software development industrial case studies. We propose that this technology-dependent framework can be used as a strawman for a guideline of data collection, analysis, and reporting of industrial case studies. Our goal in offering the framework as a strawman is to solicit input from the community on a guideline for the essential components of a technology-dependent framework for industrial case study research.

abstract={Today, the largest and most desirable portion of the radio spectrum is allocated to licensed services, which has resulted in the well-known profound scarcity of this resource for emerging applications. With the rapid growth of wireless technologies, current spectrum scarcity has become a serious problem as more and more wireless applications compete for very little spectrum. On the other hand, the licensed spectrum allocated to applications such as television, cellular telephony and public safety show very little usage over time at different geographical locations. This has, therefore, seriously impaired the evolution of newer technologies because of current regulatory constraints on the operation in licensed spectrum, such as TV bands, and is being addressed by FCC through recent rule makings. With the goal of ubiquitous communication in mind, we look into spectrum agile radios as a new technology enabled by such emerging regulatory rulings and study its advantages over conventional radios. Initially, we provide a simple mathematical modeling to understand the utilization that is achievable by spectrum agile radios. Next, we investigate several issues related to spectrum sensing, as it is one of the key pillars to realize spectrum agile radios. Through sensing, the spectrum agile radio identifies the so-called "white-spaces" in the spectrum and then decides whether to occupy those white spaces opportunistically to transmit data. We also discuss the concept of interference temperature introduced by the FCC, and propose a spectrum-aware sensor network as a way to address it. Finally, we extend this spectrum-aware sensor networks to introduce a new sensing architecture to identify and locate white spaces in the spectrum. © 2005 IEEE.},

abstract={Reverse engineering is an imperfect process when comprehending a legacy system with large volume of source code and complicated business rules. It is important for the adopted software process to shorten the time to market and minimize the risks especially in distributed environment. In this paper, Extreme Programming (XP) was evaluated in a distributed legacy system reengineering project to handle the imperfect system requirement and response to rapid business request combination while the customer was offshore. Some important adjustment was made to the XP process according to the project environment. The reengineering tasks of large scale were divided into several subtasks through evolving reengineering. XP made these tasks comparatively independent, reduced the workload of analysis in reverse engineering, and improved the performance of analysis. Localized analysis made testing and tracing easier, so the complexity of reengineering project was reduced. Evolving reengineering helped us to conduct and fulfill reverse engineering and forward engineering in parallel and shorten project lifecycle. XP enabled us to deliver better quality code in a shorter period of time with low cost. © 2005 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper discusses connections between a national culture and the culture inspired by software development methods (SDMs). Specifically, based on our research on cultural issues related to software development teams, we propose a model that can help predict whether a specific SDM fits a specific national culture. This model first defines the terms 'tightness of an SDM' and 'tightness of a national culture'. With respect to an SDM, this term articulates the idea that the tighter an SDM is, the more ordered the software development process and environment it inspires will be; with respect to a national culture, the term 'tightness' reflects the degree to which a culture accepts and adopts ordered, planned and procedural work habits. The model then goes on to outline means that can help in the mapping of a given SDM, as well as a given national culture, along the following five dimensions: Project plan, procedures and standards, responsibility, time estimation, and individual need satisfaction. Finally, based on these mappings, the fitness of a given SDM and a national culture is examined. It is proposed that this fitness can serve as a tool for predicting the degree to which a given SDM will be accepted by a specific national culture in general, and by a specific team that is part of that culture, in particular. The model is illustrated using the Israeli hi-tech industry as an example of a national culture and Extreme Programming (XP) as an example of an SDM. © 2005 IEEE.},

abstract={Scenario based notations are becoming more and more popular as means for user requirements elicitation. They can be used in more formal specifications as part of detailed use case templates or in agile processes to capture informal user stories. Despite their significance in software engineering, scenarios seem not to be properly supported by appropriate tools. This paper describes a scenario construction tool that offers clear separation of the actual story from notions used therein. The tool is constructed as an extension to visual notation of UML's use cases. It is based on an extended UML metamodel in the area of activities and classifiers. This formal basis makes the tool capable of supplying the existing UML tools with an additional layer of requirements models based on scenarios and notions. This layer makes it possible to transform requirements directly into design-level models. The tool offers such transformation capabilities based on a simple model mapping. This transformation supports human efforts to keep the system's design consistent with the user's needs expressed through scenarios. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

abstract={Since VA Software adopted XP 21/2 years ago, the understanding of quality and the product quality itself have changed dramatically. Befor we started with XP our code had alpha quality. Features were tolerably implemented, the UI was very bad and documentation was not even started. Today, the complete product (code, UI, documentation, SDKs) is constantly at pre-GA level. At any point in our development we can provide prereleases to our customers without any additional testing or release effort. Before we adopted XP it took us up to 11/2 man years (6 QA engineers for 3 months) to bring a product release from development end to release. Our first XP release required 6 man months (4 QA engineers for 6 weeks). Now we are down to 4.5 man weeks (11/2 QA engineers for 3 weeks). For experienced XP practitioners it might seem strange that the quality did not immediately jump to the high level that we have today after adopting XP. This was caused by a scenario that seems to be very typical for companies that have an established waterfall-based development process: the engineering team was enthusiastic about the new way of development, the product management team was indifferent and Tthe QA team was highly skeptical of the promise of XP to generate an (almost) bug-free product without a long and manual testing effort after development was done. Nobody in the engineering or product management team had any experience with XP, so it was impossible to convince the QA team otherwise. (In fact, reports of bug-free code from other XP teams were more intimidating then inspiring) So, we started our XP process without full QA involvement and a full system test phase after development was done. This paper recounts the evolution of our development process. It shows all the phases that our process went through, major changes that we made and what the overall impact was. © 2005 IEEE.},

abstract={The Architecting session examined the development of software architectures. Seven papers were presented, covering both the state of the practice and new architecting approaches. Based on the paper presentations and subsequent discussions, we concluded that tool support is a barrier to adoption of methods, and that architectural knowledge, including domain-specific knowledge and understanding of patterns and styles is essential but difficult to communicate. A related issue, the documentation of an architecture, is similarly critical but not easy to do well, and better techniques and tools are needed. Finally, we agreed that agile methods do not bring fundamental changes to the practice of architecting. © 2005 IEEE.},

abstract={Introduction: Emergency medical service of Capital Prague (EMSCP) has specific requirements for information system functionality because of relative big amount of patients. The information system used currently by (EMSCP) has as primary purpose to prepare reports about health care provided for Insurance companies and has become insufficient in other above mentioned areas. Because no other relevant information system vendor was found on local market, the decision to develop such system "from scratch" was taken. Methods: The analysis objectives were the creation of EMSCP object model and functional requirements specification that will be implemented in final system. Object model was prepared in team cooperation with EMSCP representatives. The quantity of information kept by each model's objects was specified. The final system is developed using object oriented programming during analysis results implementation into source code. This approach makes system modular and extensible. Basic principles of Extreme programming are used in project. Results: After application of standards for Management of information to object oriented analysis results the final metaphor of system was fixed. The model supports following requirements: Authorization of data access and data change by system user is based on Role & Permission model where permissions are grouped into roles that are then assigned to system user. This model provides possibility to assign different level of access authorization to different system users (physician, nurse, insurance report maker, system administrator, etc.). Each data change by use is uniquely identified (who, when and from which client machine made data changed). Audit of changes made by user during session (possibility to reconstruct exact user activities). During each change the former data record is moved and kept into history (workflow analysis, change of data back to specific time in history). Conclusion: Circa 65% of system analysis is currently implemented into source code, so it is still very soon for evaluation of general system and its contribution to EMSCP users. Anyway the experience with project shows that chosen methodology makes system dynamic, live and adaptive to change request.},

Based on the short cycles existing in the bipartite graph, an importance sampling simulation technique is used to identify the bit and check node combinations that are the dominant sources of error events, called trapping sets. Then, the identified trapping sets are used in the decoding process to avoid the pre-known failures and to converge to the transmitted codeword. With a minimal additional decoding complexity, the proposed technique is able to provide performance improvements for short-length LDPC codes and push or avoid error-floor behaviors of longer codes. © 2005 IEEE.},

abstract={ATX offers an integrated set of architectural and re-engineering technologies that, through methods and tools tested in large critical projects, can support long-term strategies of transitioning legacy business functions to core agile services that can sustain crucial competitiveness in the volatile markets of today. Such strategies are being pursued by an increasing number of major IT consumers such as financial institutions, telecoms, and public administration, in response to the need to operate, as first-class players, in the e-Economy. The fact that the systems in place at these organizations still run on legacy technology (e.g. COBOL) has created the need for reengineering and enterprise integration technologies. The solutions that are currently in place are typical based on: internal, labour-intensive migration with low-productivity, high costs and risk, or expensive outsourcing to consultancy companies currently using shallow tactical and generalist approaches. In both cases, these attempts at re-engineering systems are just addressing short-term needs, leading rapidly to a new generation of legacy. ATX has been working in the architectural structures that can make systems agile and reactive to the way the target business domain will change. Our re-engineering methods and technologies go well beyond the revamping of code. They are based on rigorous and well-established techniques that allow the re-engineering to operate at the level of the business logic and, therefore, align the system architecture with the way markets evolve. The architectural approach that we will be describing is based on the crucial separation of concerns between: Computation, Coordination, and Configuration. This separation needs to be supported at two different levels. On the one hand, through semantic primitives that address the "business architecture", i.e. the means that need to be provided for modeling business entities (Computation), the business rules that determine how the entities can interact (Coordination), and the business contexts through which specific rules can be superposed, at run-time, to specific entities (Configuration).},

abstract={Introduction: Advancements in IT and the growing trend for virtual information have influenced the need for enabling technologies. Enterprise networking and computing are the central technology for practice and delivery in health sciences, which are one of the knowledge areas to gain most from these developments. The Web has come to serve as an everyday platform for learning were academics, researchers, students and professionals need access to the most current information. Portals are currently a gateway to information and services on the Web and it would be difficult to work in any IT related field without them. The Centre for Biomedical Image Analysis (CAIBCO) at the Institute for Tropical Diseases, Universidad Central de Venezuela, has as one of its goals the dissemination of biomedical research knowledge generated by the academia in the Ibero-American region. Although there are well-known prestigious first-world institutions working in this field, the pathologies behave differently in different countries. Malaria in Africa and the Americas has diverse transmission modalities, having also different prevention strategies, Sparganum Proliferum a rare parasite recently identified in Venezuela has been detected in only eight clinical cases world-wide in the past, scorpions of the Genus Tytius, the main local cause of envenoming, may be completely unknown to medical students in developed regions. Moreover, Venezuela as one of the leading countries in the study of tropical diseases has academic knowledge that could contribute to the general body of knowledge. Methods: A knowledge meta-portal, a portal that is a gateway to other portals, was developed (http://caibco.ucv.ve) providing access to thematic pages on diseases such as Malaria, Chagas, and Scorpions [1]. However, it is more than a site providing content; it offers also an integrated set of tools for interactive creation, management and publication of biomedical knowledge. The following tools are currently available: a virtual conference generator, a digital book publisher, and the Vitae tool. VITAE is a digital publication, regularly published as a showcase of the work of individual researchers, focused at increasing the accessibility and influence of biomedical research to health care professionals, students and decision makers in organizations. Until recently, the information (e.g.: clinical cases, research papers, epidemiological alerts) was manually set up, stored in flat files (.html,.doc,.gif,.jpg,.tif,.psd,.ps,.pdf,.ppt,.xls), and published. The effort involved in preparing each issue, inflexibility of the process, redundancy and lack of data integrity, were some of the difficulties encountered. Results: Since 1999, twenty-three issues of VITAE have been published, containing clinical cases and on-going research reviewed by forty editors in different specialization areas. The Vitae Tool is a strategic web application to improve the generation and publication of VITAE issues making it easier to set up web pages that house publications and that also have links to other outlets. It was developed using a 3-tier architecture [4] on a Solaris/Oracle9i platform with Java technology [3] and agile development methods [2]. Discussion: Some of the results obtained since VITAE is being published are: on the average 4000 monthly visits, support by local pharmaceutical industries, and as its content is certified by qualified researchers VITAE is a point of academic reference. Although the potential benefits of this type of initiatives are rather obvious, difficulties remain in how best to assess the effect of an IT project on technological change. The meta-portal and its tools allow a firmer commitment of the involved institutions to promote science and technology in the region. Through the diffusion of the various research activities carried out locally and regionally, it may also facilitate the establishment of long-term collaborative research projects and reinforce institutional research and teaching links, as well as promote the generation and dissemination of new knowledge and relevant information, such as statistical data. A further and central question to consider thoroughly is the organizational commitment for the continuous gathering and updating of information and definition of strategies to guarantee effectively that this is done properly. The commitment should endure the different possible organizational changes at different levels.},

abstract={In the fast-paced global economy, a corporation must be flexible and agile to meet the shifting needs of operating in an on demand environment. Aligning information technology (IT) systems using service-oriented architecture (SOA) to provide end-to-end enterprise integration and virtualized IT services is a critical step. To be truly effective, however, the SOA paradigm also needs to be extended to transmute organizational structures and behavioral practices. in this paper, we first explore the governance, economic, and enterprise challenges to SOA-based IT transformation. Next, we raise the need to redesign the existing organizational models, and we propose the Human Services Bus (HSB), a new organizational structure that optimizes the workforce and streamlines cross-unit processes to leverage the new IT systems. Finally, we discuss the cultural transformation that is required to support the HSB transition and induce the changes required in management and behavioral practices. The issues and insights at all three layers - IT systems, organizational structures, and cultural practices - are based on IBM's experience with adopting on demand methods. © Copyright 2005 by International Business Machines Corporation.},

Findings - SPI initiatives easily get interrupted, are side-tracked, and progress slowly due to changing environments. While most practitioners are painfully aware of this, the SPI literature has so far only touched on the issue. Agility principles would have helped Ericsson respond more effectively to events that impacted the initiative. Development of agile SPI practices requires coordination and alignment with other initiatives to develop agile software organizations.

abstract={As software organisations mature, their repositories of reusable software components from previous projects will also grow considerably. Remaining conversant with all components in such a repository presents a significant challenge to developers. Indeed the retrieval of a particular component in this large search space may prove problematic. Further to this, the reuse of components developed in an Agile environment is likely to be hampered by the existence of little or no support materials. We propose to infer the need for a component and proactively recommend that component to the developer using a technique which is consistent with the principles of Agile methodologies. Our RASCAL recommender agent tracks usage histories of a group of developers to recommend to an individual developer components that are expected to be needed by that developer. Unlike many traditional recommender systems, we may recommend items that the developer has actually employed previously. We introduce a content-based filtering technique for ordering the set of recommended software components and present a comparative analysis of applying this technique to a number of collaborative filtering algorithms. We also investigate the relationship between the number of usage histories collected and recommendation accuracy. Our overall results indicate that RASCAL is a very promising tool for allowing developers discover reusable components at no additional cost. © Springer 2005.},

abstract={Businesses need to continuously focus on change and innovation in order to survive in dynamic environments. The ability of an organization to deploy appropriate business processes requires that the fit between business processes and systems that support the management of these processes is continuously maintained and evolved. Acquisition and use of the knowledge about the context in which business processes are defined, modified, and implemented can help maintain this fit. We identify requirements for a business process management system (BPMS) capable of managing contextual knowledge. Based on these requirements, we have enhanced KOPeR, a knowledge-based system for business process improvement, with an explanation facility that can acquire and maintain knowledge about the context behind process definitions and design choices. A case study that illustrates the functionalities of this system which is designed to improve the fit between business processes and BPMS is presented. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2005.},

abstract={Web service composition is an important technology for agile inter-enterprise application integration. Centric composition engines are widely adopted to enact composite services in many Web service composition research projects. Such a centralized architecture, however, results in problem of scalability, message exchange efficiency and autonomy. A role-based decentralized approach for service composition is proposed, which partitions the global process model of a composite service into local process models according to the participant roles so as to distribute the control logic of a composite service and corresponding execution load into multiple nodes. An algorithm of generating the local process models is presented in detail with deployment and execution mechanism introduced. Simulation results indicate that this approach can support highly concurrent requests and large volume of data more effectively than the centralized architecture, so it is helpful to improve the scalability of composite services.},

This article presents the work practice in dealing with the adaptation of such a method in the ISD department of one of the leading financial institutes in Europe. Two forms of method adaptation, static adaptation and dynamic adaptation, are introduced and discussed in detail. We provide some insights plus an instrument that the ISD department studied uses to deal with the dynamic method adaptation. To enhance our understanding of the observed practice, we take into account two complementary perspectives: the engineering perspective and the socio-organizational perspective.

abstract={Agile approaches to software development provide flexibility within the method, but provide little or no flexibility to support software process improvement (SPI). This second kind of flexibility is important to permit organizations to improve with time. To accomplish such improvement, a method-engineering approach is shown here to be useful. Examples of the application of method engineering to agile method construction are given based on the use of the OPEN process framework. A dual-agility method to support both intraproject and interproject flexibility can then be constructed by the selection of appropriate method fragments from this repository with the use of the accompanying guidelines. This is illustrated in an industry study of an organization transitioning to an agile software-development environment in which a minimalistic agile method was first constructed and then enhancements were made as the organization itself improved the process.

abstract={On January 14, 2004, two vice presidents met with a group of directors, project managers, and developers, and indicated their desire to embrace agile software development as "the way forward" in their organization. This was not the beginning of this company's adoption of XP and Agile Methodologies, but rather the culmination of almost two and a half years of learning, experimentation, prototyping, and promotion. Making change "stick" in any large organization is problematic, and dramatically changing the way a risk-averse, highly-regulated company develops software requires more than just a successful pilot and a couple of months of coaching. This experience report documents the "agile journey" undertaken by one such corporation between 2001 and 2004. They began by outsourcing a small effort to an XP-proficient consulting firm, and proceeded to use agile techniques on a series of increasingly-significant efforts, allowing sufficient time for the new approach to gain acceptance. In retrospect, all parties involved now believe that the slow, gradual approach to XP adoption - building on incremental successes project by project - was the key to its success. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

I will start by discussing the characteristics of critical systems development, such as the need to justify claims about the system dependability, and the differences in development culture between XP and critical systems development. I will then go on to discuss how different XP practices reduce or increase the risks of software failure, especially when the reality of implementing XP is considered. I will identify weaknesses in the XP process, such as the use of user stories for requirements definition, that have to be addressed before XP practices will be considered by the critical systems community. I will then suggest how the cultural barriers between the communities might be broken down and will propose how it might be possible to adapt XP practice to the development of some types of critical system by introducing 'dependability spikes' into the XP process. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

A version of CppUnitLite was modified to meet the memory and speed constraints present on self-contained, high performance, digital signal processing (DSP) systems. The specific characteristics of DSP systems required that the concept of refactoring be extended to include concepts such as "refactoring for speed". We provide an experience report describing the instructor-related advantages of introducing an embedded test driven development tool E-TDD into third and fourth year undergraduate Computer Engineering Hardware-Software Co-design Laboratories. The TDD format permitted customer (instructor) hardware and software tests to be specified as "targets" so that the requirements for the components and full project were known "up-front". Details of CppUnitLit extensions necessary to permit tests specific for a small hardware-software co-design project, and lessons learnt when using the current E-TDD tool, are given.

To cope with this we introduced to our projects a proxy-customer role resembling RUP's Analyst and we equipped him with a tool, called UC Workbench, that supports the communication with the customer representatives and the developers. Analyst collects user stories from customer representatives and 'translates' them into use cases.

abstract={Methodology adoption issues in the agile world are faced with challenges such as the growing trend towards the use of a group of relevant cross-methodology practices from the agile family as opposed to the adoption of individual methodologies. While this may see agile processes precipitating towards more mature software engineering processes, the challenge is that some of the specific agile methodologies may become extinct over time. This research therefore contributes a key addition to knowledge by developing a thinking tool that will guide system developers to informatively select agile practices from the entire agile methodologies family that are relevant to the project at hand. This paper proposes a novel modeling technique for tailoring methodologies to a particular environment using the family of methodologies approach. The Agile Methodologies Generic (AMG) model considers agile methodologies as a group of methodologies with common parameters that can be used to model the entire group. Based on this model, methodology parameters can be identified that are common among the different agile methodologies making it possible to create a set of relevant agile practices that can be used in an organization. The original concepts of the model are based on two foundations: 1) the philosophy of Jim Highsmith's Adaptive Software Development (ASD) methodology. ASD focuses on the speculate, collaborate and learn cycle iteratively which is fundamental to agile development, and 2) the concept of organizational maturity levels which says that mature organizations families of repeatable and automated processes. It is from such a perspective that AMG was born. AMG considers agile methodologies at an abstract level where the four values of the Agile Manifesto are assumed to collectively constitute basic philosophy of all agile methodologies. The phases of AMG (mechanistic, organic, and synergistic adaptation) are therefore analyzed in light of the values of the project at hand. The benefits of such a technology is the provision of a thinking tool that assists software development teams to effectively tailor agile methodologies to their project environments. The tool has been applied by two software development organisations and the results are being analysed. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

abstract={The eXtreme Programming (XP) method eschews all formal design, but compensates for this by rigorous unit testing. Test-sets, which constitute the only enduring specification, are intuitively developed and so may not be complete. This paper presents a method for generating complete unit test-sets for objects, based on simple finite state machines. Using this method, it is possible to prove that saved regression test-sets do not provide the expected guarantees of correctness when applied to modified or extended objects. Such objects, which pass the saved tests, may yet contain introduced faults. This puts the whole practice of regression testing in XP into question. To obtain the same level of guarantee, tests must be regenerated from scratch for the extended object. A notion of guaranteed, repeatable quality after testing is defined. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

XP is an agile method that develops object-oriented software in very short iterations with little upfront design. Although not originally given this name, TDD was described as an integral XP practice necessary for analysis, design, and testing that also enables design through refactoring, collective ownership, continuous integration, and programmer courage. Along with pair programming and refactoring, TDD has received considerable individual attention since XP's introduction. Developers have created tools specifically to support TDD across a range of languages and have written numerous books explaining how to apply TDD concepts. Researchers have begun to examine TDD's effects on defect reduction and quality improvements in academic and professional practitioner environments, and educators have started to examine how to integrate TDD into computer science and software engineering pedagogy.},

abstract={The article studies the interaction between technical choices in virtual reality (VR) models and approaches to cultural history, for teaching and research. It is based on an ongoing project undertaken by 'Cultures Anglophones et Technologies de l'Information' at Paris-Sorbonne: 'Montmartre in the jazz age', a model of Montmartre in the late 1920s, when African-American musicians brought jazz to cabarets. Integrating it into the curriculum modifies the research/teaching interaction: it involves students in projects in progress; it encourages them to undertake interdisciplinary studies, involving computing skills and research in topography or music history. The issues that arise in the authoring of the project are a contribution to the problematics of cultural history; modelling the Montmartre environment from early documents (maps, photographs, which have to be edited with specialized software) shows how relative and incomplete they are - and thus how relative and composite our own modelling is. This composite character is in keeping with the 'spirit of place' of a multicultural area; VR is an elaborate structure, starting from a 3D model, with interior and exterior views, wireframes and textures; the medium is suited to the message: the recreation of a complex environment of spaces and subspaces throwing into focus contact points between French traditional songs and American jazz. The VR projects underline issues in the humanities; involving students increases their awareness of new problematics. The present article shows how new methods in humanities computing, in the field of visualization, alter and enrich humanities disciplines. It documents the authoring of a VR model, and the introduction of an Information Technology research project into the university teaching process: 'Montmartre in the jazz age', a multidisciplinary humanities adventure involving a digital reconstruction of part of this famous Paris area, the 'Lapin Agile' cabaret in the first instance. It argues that the involvement of research students in such projects not only gives them IT skills, but also adds to their critical understanding of humanities issues. © The Author.

abstract={Telecommunications operators are undergoing massive transformations in order to metamorphose themselves into the ICT world and compete with agile, lean IT organisations. The main challenges facing telecommunications operators, such as BT, are to reduce costs and increase agility in deploying software systems for provisioning ICT services. Despite using reusable capabilities and COTS packages, the major source of increased cost lies in the heavy integration tax we incur for integrating diverse systems implemented on diverse platforms and middleware, with heterogeneous data and process models. This paper looks at cost implications of lengthy and often manual migration to-and-from systems and platforms, and shows the clear business benefits of model-driven development (MDD) as defined by the Object Management Group (OMG). It is clearly demonstrated that model-driven development has matured into a practical, industrialised, scalable and evolvable technology, culminating from decades of R&D on specification and design languages, executable formalisms and domainspecific languages and language transformations. © British Telecommunications plc 2005.},

abstract={Introduction: Electronic syndromic surveillance may have value in detecting emerging pathogens or a biological weapons release. Hospitals that have an agile process to evaluate chief complaints of patients seeking emergency care may be able to more quickly identify subtle changes in the community's health. An easily adaptable prototype system was developed to monitor emergency department patient visits during the Kentucky Derby Festival in Louisville, Kentucky, from April 16-May 14, 2002. Use of the system was continued during the same festival periods in 2003 and 2004. Method: Twelve area hospitals in Louisville, Kentucky, participated in a prospective analysis of the chief symptoms of patients who sought care in the emergency department during the Kentucky Derby Festival during 2002. Six hospitals were classified as computer record groups (CRG) and used their existing computerized record capabilities. The other 6 hospitals used a personal digital assistant (PDA) with customized software (PDA group). Data were evaluated by the health department epidemiologist using SaTScan, a modified version of a cancer cluster detection program, to look for clusters of cases above baseline over time and by Zip code. Results: All 12 hospitals were able to collect and provide data elements during the study period. The 6 CRG hospitals were able to perform daily data transmission; however, 3 CRG hospitals were unable to interpret their data because it was transmitted in pure text format. In contrast, data from all 6 PDA group hospitals were interpretable. Real-time data analysis was compared with postevent data, and it was found that the real-time evaluation correctly identified no unusual disease activity during the study period. Conclusions: The 12 hospitals participating in this study demonstrated that community-wide surveillance using computerized data was possible and that the 6 study hospitals using a PDA could quickly interpret emergency department patients' chief complaints. The emergency department chief complaints group could serve as a disease sentinel for the community. Copyright © 2005 by the Emergency Nurses Association.},

abstract={The Object-Relational (O-R) approach to persistence is alive and well. It is based upon the proven and reliable relational database approach, and provides choice from a range of well-supported Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) packages. Major compiler and systems support players continue to offer increased features (e.g. object data-type definition and storage support in Microsoft's ADO.Net in Windows 2005), which are supportive of the O-R approach and contribute to a healthy O-R future. With the appropriate design techniques and persistence software support, the O-R approach represents the fastest, most reliable way to develop efficient, scalable, maintainable applications software. An added bonus is that the skill set of developers transferring from Relational-Procedural to Object Oriented (OO) application development is well suited to the O-R approach. With appropriate persistence support software, business object mapping and persistence can be automated, freeing application developers from the time-consuming tasks of mapping objects to database tables and the (re)writing of database access code. The O-R approach can be a SQL-free experience, allowing developers to concentrate on CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) access and processing of individual or groups of business objects without having to worry about the underpinning relational database framework being used to persist business object data. The object-oriented application development becomes transformed into a simple 3-step process: 1. Develop an Implementation Object Class Model, 2. Generate the Business Objects and Object Database for object persistence, and 3. Code and test the application based upon the Business Objects. The key to success for this development process lies in the first step, 'develop an Implementation Object Class Model', because the way in which object class associations are implemented can significantly affect the performance of applications that depend upon them. Conversely, any time and effort spent producing a good business class design can be completely negated in terms of object access performance due to poor association implementation. The UML design process, which is pivotal to any OO development, places considerable emphasis upon the identification and differentiation of associations between objects. One significant weakness of the UML design process is the provision of too little support for implementation planning too late in the development process. This article tackles this problem by introducing some simple high-level implementation semantics for association implementation using the UML Object Class diagram. It discusses data structures and logic support to underpin various alternatives using an OR approach, and shows how implementation planning for associations can fit into the application development cycle to form the basis of an agile, practical and targeted OO application development methodology.},

abstract={TYPHOON is a capability-aware peer-to-peer (P2P) system. It exploits the heterogeneity of nodes in the system based on the concept of virtual homes. Nodes participating in the system are classified as good and inactive. TYPHOON uses resources provided by good peers. It is thus more reliable and agile than a naive structured P2P system. When a good peer is overloaded, it picks a suitable inactive node and migrates some loads (i.e., virtual homes) to that node. However, migration of virtual homes may cause instability in the system. TYPHOON thus incorporates a mechanism for tracking virtual homes. A migrated home can receive states of relevant homes using an adaptive, logical tree structure that can also react to system heterogeneity, node loading and network locality. A migrated home can also proactively discover the state of an interested home to ensure the correctness of lookup. We evaluate TYPHOON using theoretical and simulation analysis. We also benchmark TYPHOON using a prototype system on 34 desktop PCs. The results all confirm the effectiveness of TYPHOON. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

A department at Ericsson AB introduced a test automation tool for component-level testing in two projects together with the concept test-driven development (TDD), a practice where the test code is written before the product code. The implemented approach differs from how TDD is used in Extreme Programming (XP) in that the tests are written for components exchanging XMLs instead of writing tests for every method in every class. This paper describes the implemented test automation tool, how test-driven development was implemented with the tool, and experiences from the implementation. Preliminary results indicate that the concept decreases the development lead-time significantly. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In this paper we describe our view of how extreme programming fits into the software engineering curriculum, our approach to teaching it, and our experiences, based on two years of running these courses. Particularly important aspects of our set up include team coaching (by older students), fixed working hours, and colocation during development.

abstract={Gibbons, like orangutans, are a group of threatened Asian apes, so that genetic monitoring of each species or subspecies is a pressing need for conservation programmes. We conducted a project to take, as far as possible, samples of known origin from wild-born animals from Sumatra and Borneo (Central Kalimantan) for genetic monitoring of agile gibbons. As a result, we found a whole arm translocation between chromosomes 8 and 9 (WAT8/9) specific to Sumatran agile gibbons. Furthermore, population surveys suggested that the form with the WAT8/9 seems to be incompatible with an ancestral form, suggesting that the former might have extinguished the latter from Sumatran populations by competition. In any case, this translocation is a useful chromosomal marker for identifying Sumatran agile gibbons. Population genetic analyses with DNA showed that the molecular genetic distance between Sumatran and Bornean agile gibbons is the smallest, although the chromosomal difference is the largest. Thus, it is postulated that WAT8/9 occurred and fixed in a small population of Sumatra after migration and geographical isolation at the last glacial period, and afterwards dispersed rapidly to other populations in Sumatra as a result of the bottleneck effect and a chromosomal isolating mechanism. © 2005 Springer.},

abstract={Adult caddisflies were collected at 12 sites along a 5 km stretch of a forested headwater stream in southeastern Ghana in March and November 1993 and the catches are related to environmental variables. Some 34,000 specimens, belonging to 178 morphospecies in 43 genera and 11 families, were caught with Malaise traps and light traps. Many species demonstrate differences between sampling method, seasonal occurrence, and sex-ratios, with the light trap in the second wet sunny season (November) being most efficient with respect to the diversity of the catches. A Moran index analysis for global structures indicates a major transition in the fauna from the ravine with waterfalls to the forest, and secondly, a gradient through the forest. A Geary index analysis for local structures indicates further faunal turnovers in the lower reaches of the stream. Species-environment relationships were analyzed through correspondence analysis and co-inertia analysis, allowing ordination of both species and the environment into three zones. The first co-inertia axis reveals a transition between the waterfalls in the open ravine (sites 1-3), and the stream through the riverine forest (sites 4-12), while the second co-inertia axis reveals a gradient from the lotic stream in the moist semi-deciduous forest (sites 4-8) to more lentic stretches of the stream in a gradually more depleted forest (sites 9-12). The most important environmental factors related to the species transition are: riparian moss growth (r = 0.94), leaves in the stream substratum (r = 0.91), forest type (r = 0.90), hygropetric surfaces (r = 0.88), bedrock (r = 0.87), lotic [riffle] (r = 0.85) and lentic [pool] (r = 0.85) stretches. The most important environmental factors related to the species gradient are: lotic [riffle] stretches (r = 0.92), gravel (r = 0.88) and leaves (r = 0.85) in the stream substratum, forest type (r=0.81), and agricultural use (r=0.76). Three clusters representing three major environmental zones (zone I, II and III) along the stream are identified by projecting the average species positions on the co-inertia plane. By analyzing the Malaise trap samples significant indicator values are found for 29 species in zone I, 16 species in zone II, and 18 species in zone III. By analyzing the light trap samples significant indicator values are found for 17 species in zone I, 57 species in zone II, and 38 species in zone III. The high diversity of caddisflies in the sanctuary might be reflected both in the geological and climatological history of West Africa, as well as in the recognition of three major environmental zones, and the clean water with high diversity of stream microhabitats favorable for Trichoptera larvae. The closed forest seems to play an important role for the Trichoptera community, and the study demonstrates the importance of protecting forested headwater streams in order to maintain a sustainable aquatic biodiversity in tropical Africa. © Springer 2005.},

TXL is designed to allow explicit programmer control over the interpretation, application, order and backtracking of both parsing and rewriting rules. Using first order functional programming at the higher level and term rewriting at the lower level, TXL provides for flexible programming of traversals, strategies, guards, scope of application and parameterized context. This flexibility has allowed TXL users to express and experiment with both new ideas in parsing, such as robust, island and agile parsing, and new paradigms in rewriting, such as XML markup, rewriting strategies and contextualized rules, without any change to TXL itself. In this paper I outline the history, evolution and concepts of TXL with emphasis on what makes it different from other language manipulation tools, and give examples of its use in expressing and applying recent new paradigms in language processing. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={An agile mask data preparation (MDP) approach is proposed to cut re-fracture cycle time as incurred by mask writer dispatching policy changes. Shorter re-fracture cycle time increases the flexibility of mask writer dispatching, as a result, mask writer's capacity can be utilized to its optimum. Preliminary results demonstrate promising benefits in MDP cycle time reduction and writer dispatching flexibility improvement. The agile MDP can save up to 40% of re-fracture cycle time. OASIS (Open Artwork System Interchange Standard) was proposed to address the GDSII file size explosion problem. However, OASIS has yet to gain wide acceptance in the mask industry. The authors envision OASIS adoption by the mask industry as a three-phase process and identify key issues of each phase from the mask manufacturer's perspective. As a long-term MDP flow reengineering project, an agile MDP and writer dispatching approach based on OASIS is proposed. The paper describes the results of an extensive evaluation on OASIS performance compared to that of GDSII, both original GDSII and post-OPC GDSII files. The file size of eighty percent of the original GDSII files is more than ten times larger compared to that of its OASIS counterpart.},

abstract={Agile optical amplifiers must preserve constant gain and flatness over a wide range of input conditions to meet the needs of reconfigurable optical networks. Though routers and switches used to perform system protection or network reconfiguration feature slow transition times, reported theoretical and experimental analyses of the dynamics of agile EDFAs have focused on fast, sub-microsecond input-signal transitions. As a result, only low population inversion, one-or two-stage baseline amplifiers practically provide acceptable transient performance over the entire dynamic and wavelength range of operation. On the other hand, advanced, versatile optical amplifiers, which are highly desirable to perform system-level controls such as gain adjustment or reconfigurable wavelength add-drops at mid-stage, feature large excursions in these input conditions. In this paper, we discuss the line-transient times in view of today's switching technologies and Standards and provide experimental evidence of the suitable performance of advanced agile amplifiers at system switch speeds. The amplifier used is a very high-performance, agile device, which relies on a 3 μs feedback loop. Input transients up to 15 dB were studied, showing excursions smaller than 1 dB and steady-state gain errors no larger than 0.2 dB.},

The Sabre team was a characteristically agile team in that they had no need to scale or re-scope XP for their project parameters and organizational environment. The case study compares two releases of the same product. One release was completed just prior to the team's adoption of the XP methodology, and the other was completed after approximately two years of XP use. Comparisons of the new release project results to the old release project results show a 50% increase in productivity, a 65% improvement in pre-release quality, and a 35% improvement in post-release quality. These findings suggest that, over time, adopting the XP process can result in increased productivity and quality. © 2004 IEEE.},

abstract={Many students begin to form their software development habits in introductory programming courses. Although problem-solving strategies and other good practices are taught at the introductory level, early experiences in programming tend to involve small assignments and so students do not always see the benefits and value of good software engineering practices. Consequently, they develop habits which are hard to break later when faced with significant problems where good practices are essential for success. Furthermore, students report that typical CS1 lab experiences tend to be unsatisfactory and even irrelevant. In order to give the students early meaningful experiences in developing good habits using a software engineering methodology which fits the limited time-constraints of the academic environment, eXtreme Programming (XP) was employed for the lab portion of a second semester CS1 course. This paper describes how XP practices were incorporated into a semester-long project where classes met once a week in a closed lab. Specific affective objectives were also introduced which were measured quantitatively and qualitatively. This paper describes our methodology, assessment, results, and plans for improvement. © Springer-Verlag 2004.},

abstract={Agile Methods are creating a buzz in the software development community, drawing their fair share of advocates and opponents. While some people consider agile methods the best thing that has happened to software development in recent years, other people view them as a backlash to software engineering and compare them to hacking. The aim of this chapter is to introduce the reader to agile methods allowing him/her to judge whether or not agile methods could be useful in modern software development. The chapter discusses the history behind agile methods as well as the agile manifesto, a statement from the leaders of the agile movement. It looks at what it means to be agile, discusses the role of management, describes and compares some of the more popular agile methods, provides a guide for deciding where an agile approach is applicable, and lists common criticisms. It summarizes empirical studies, anecdotal reports, and lessons learned from applying agile methods and concludes with an analysis of various agile methods. The target audiences for this chapter include practitioners, who will be interested in the discussion of the different methods and their applications, researchers who may want to focus on the empirical studies and lessons learned, and educators looking to teach and learn more about agile methods. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

During adoption of the XP process, teams can misapply the XP principles by following them verbatim, ignoring the context in which they are applied. In this paper we document our experiences where naive applications of XP principles were altered in recognition of context. We detail our observations of how teams "looked behind" the rules and began fitting XP to the problem rather than attempting to fit the problem to XP. We conclude by reflectively focusing on how this transformation occurred and suggest that it is buying into the XP ethos that drives this change of perspective on the XP process and principles. © 2004 IEEE.},

abstract={Agility refers to an enterprise's ability to respond efficiently and effectively to all levels and types of change. From an IT perspective, the challenge has been to address the problems associated with the flexibility of business processes while taking into account the existing monolithic legacy IT systems. Web Services represent an emerging model for developing and deploying enterprise software applications by improving the flexibility and reach of existing IT infrastructure. At the least, Web Services promise to fundamentally change the manner of enterprise application development and deployment. It has strategic implications for enterprises, which form networks of interrelated businesses operating in a collaborative manner. Towards this, legacy IT systems play a limited role towards achieving the desired levels of business process flexibility, thereby affecting enterprise agility. In this paper, we have examined the predominant technology issue of integration, and the key role of Service Oriented Architectures, in enhancing business agility. The theoretical and conceptual learnings are used to propose a generic framework which breaks down the progression towards a service oriented enterprise (defined as the end goal of enterprise integration efforts) into four phases.},

abstract={This paper examines how documentation is used to create "quality" engineering processes in software development, focusing on recent industry trends of adopting use case driven software engineering models, to investigate a phenomenon that in this paper I call "genre dumping. " The paper aims to address questions about how software development methods change under a use-case driven model. For example, is it really that easy to adopt the use case methodology? The paper draws from a 24-month case study of a small cross-disciplinary team of software designers, developers, testers, and managers who are helping build a large in-house application for a multinational financial services corporation called "Financial Capital" (pseudonym). This project was selected for study because a use case driven model was being applied to explicitly change software engineering practices: use cases were newly adopted and thus unfamiliar to those involved in the software development project. Presented are selected results of qualitative and quantitative analyses of textual and interview data. The findings are interpreted using rhetorical genre theory, which features a large and growing body of workplace research about the ways documents enable (and constrain) people to get work done. The results show that textual features of the documents of the older design methods persist in the newly adopted use cases and that readers' approaches to text-related meaning making also persist, indicating generic recurrence. The findings also show that conflict occurs at the same sites where recurrence occurs. The paper concludes with discussions of implications for technical communicators and genre theorists interested in technical communication.},

When the requirements are volatile and the development environment is unstable, Extreme Programming (XP) methodology provides efficient means to cope with requirements through the onsite customer practice. However, for many software companies, having an onsite customer present is difficult to achieve. To solve this problem an Offsite Customer Process Model has been proposed earlier. This paper reports results from a study of a mobile application development project where the model was empirically evaluated. The findings show that the model itself is context-dependent and it has to be adapted to the underlying development process. Based on these findings, an improved model is introduced. It is shown that the new model proved to work efficiently and improved the developer-customer communication mechanisms. © Springer-Verlag 2004.},

abstract={Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a relatively new process developed in the early 90's by The Welding Institute (TWI) of the United Kingdom. A rotating tool with a specific geometry is used to heat the materials to be joined. The heat softened material of the abutting materials is entrained and transfered around the tool, where it is deposited prior to recoalescence, thereafter forming a joint. The FSW process requires advanced automation to ensure consistent and reliable joints. This has been realized by the development of an experimental set-up by the integration and on-line monitoring of accurate sensors with reliable modular control software. With increasing productivity and quality requirements imposed by manufacturers, machine flexibility and scalability are becoming increasingly pertinent. On-line process monitoring facilitates the 'adaption' of machines able to respond to changing process parameters and conditions. Modular open software architectures allow flexibility in machine application. This paper introduces a fresh approach for the integration of the latest automation technology into an experimental setup equipped with an advanced sensory system. A new method of capturing sensory data and the implementation aspects of the software architecture for a micro-kernel based real-time embedded operating system is introduced. Agile automation of the FSW process is thus realized by advanced monitoring and control.},

It is a practice-oriented approach which ties together methods of business process modeling, object oriented, and model transformation approaches in order to support cognitive needs of requirements holders and object oriented software developers, and provide framework for explicit and transparent representation of mutually related business and software development knowledge.

In order to establish and maintain consistency, we need to precisely define what it means for two models to be synchronized. In this paper, we present our view of model synchronization as a problem of maximizing model dependencies. Our conceptual view of software models is as graphs, and model transformations are viewed in terms of basic graph transformations such as node insertions and deletions. Based on this view, a set of transformations applied to one model is traced and propagated to the other by choosing, from a set of possible transformation paths, a path that maximizes underlying model dependencies.},

abstract={Pair programmers need a "warmup phase" before the pair can work at full speed. The length of the learning interval varies, depending on how experienced the developers are with pair programming and how familiar they are with each other. We study how large the impact of the lower pair productivity during warmup is on the business value of the pair programming project. To this end, we extend our net present value model for pair programming to explicitly include a learning interval for pairs. We then carry out a simulation study where we vary the shape of the learning curve, the length of the learning interval, the final productivity level of the pairs, the market pressure, and the size of the workforce. Our simulations show that the cost of the warmup phase is reasonably small compared to the project value, but nonetheless must be taken into account when estimating the project. Our results also suggest that the learning overhead is not an obstacle to introducing and using pair programming in a real environment. © 2004 IEEE.},

Applications must be able to react to changes in the business model and, likewise, their technology platform (i.e., architecture) must be agile. Often, the operations and environment requirements of a system affect the application's ability to be modified quickly. This article presents a methodology that combines ISO standards and UML (Unified Modeling Language) standards. The ISO model is used to identify the quality characteristics for software architecture. These attributes form an evaluation framework. Each functional requirement is defined as a use case model using UML notation. This model is expanded with the specific quality properties required based on the ISO model. The resulting use cases are prioritized on the basis of their architectural impact. With these use cases, several candidate architectures can be identified. Alternatives are compared to the evaluation framework to select one architecture design. A real-time monitoring system is used as a case study to reinforce the methodology introduced in the article.},

In this paper, we will describe how agents provide a critical technology enabler for applying emerging commercial technologies, such as web services, into network-centric warfare problems. The objective of our research is developing and sharing battlespace awareness and understanding. Our agent information service manages information collection and dissemination/publishing activities on behalf of fusion services in an autonomous, yet controllable fashion. Agents improve the scalability and reliability at the system of systems level through dynamic selection and exploitation of web services based upon needs and capabilities.},

abstract={This paper examines the nature of e-commerce systems development and finds that e-commerce is different requiring a high degree of business innovation and responsiveness. A study undertaken on a B-B e-marketplace in Egypt illustrates the problems with the use of traditional analysis and design techniques. They reduce imagination and the ability to respond to change, as they are systematic, comprehensive and plan-driven. The study focuses attention on the importance of modeling value-added services beside businesses processes for e-commerce applications, as well as the need for self-organizing, non-prescriptive activities, which we call the 'Practice', that enhances creative thinking and self-reflection on the problem situation. As a response to these findings an 'upfront requirements modeling and design practice' is identified, outlined, and experimented with. It is based on brainstorming sessions guided by the use of a 'non-prescriptive' requirements modeling tool that provides a classification of the possible different e-commerce issues. The introduced tool (the e-Business Issues Roadmap) helps to trigger issues and design ideas. The results found a number of business innovative ideas that were unlikely to have been generated by traditional analysis models.},

The empirical models are faster and easier to use for the design engineer than any numerical technique. However, it is difficult to develop accurate closed-form relationships of devices for a large range of geometric and materials parameters. Thus, we suggest two fast and accurate methods, which combine analytical relationships with an artificial neural network trained with electromagnetic data, provided by finite element software. These methods are illustrated for a tunable microwave phase shifter. Closed-form relationships have been developed and are presented in this paper. A comparison between the response of the tunable microwave phase shifter, using the methods exploiting ANN, and electromagnetic simulation data are presented. The result of these methods shows good agreement with the predicted data.},

abstract={During their usage, software systems have to be changed constantly. If such changes are implemented in an incomplete or inconsistent way a loss of architectural quality will occur, i.e. in terms of maintainability and understandability. The lack of traceability of the impact of changed requirements in the software enhances this effect. Traceability links have been proposed as a link between the requirements and the different parts of a solution. In practical use, these links are difficult to establish and maintain. Currently, tools cannot effectively support these links due to human-required decisions. This paper introduces feature models as an intermediate element for linking requirements to design models. They enable a more appropriate bridging of the different levels of abstraction. Feature models group sets of requirements to a feature and enable a modeling of the variability of requirements. The feature models structure traceability links between requirements, design elements and implementation parts. This leads to lower efforts of establishing and maintaining the links. Furthermore, descriptions of design decisions can be attached to the links. Industrial experience with this approach shows its support for the evolutionary development of large software systems, especially in the improved comprehension of the changes by the developers.},

abstract={Requirement changes and the involved rework are inevitable if the requirement change could not be foreseen. Extreme Programming (XP) suggests customer to be on site with the developers. The requirement changes may be forecasted by the on site customer from the business perspective and by the developers from the technology perspective. Extreme Programming was adopted in Lattice Trading System reengineering project. The user stories were weighed by a set of criteria which included the risk, cost, schedule, as well as the possibility to be changed. The stories were decomposed into features, and the features were organized into components. The components with less possibility to be changed were implemented earlier. Meanwhile, spikes were conducted when the decisions were being made for some critical tasks. In such a way, most components were completed without any change to their functional features while few components were implemented with large modification. The overall effort of rework was reduced considerably with this approach. Compared with the small cost for managing the change possibility, the method introduced in this paper is of significant worth.},

Use case modeling has also been a popular requirements elicitation and analysis technique for many years. However, stories, scenarios, and use cases typically exhibit a great informality that violates the traditional guidance in the requirements engineering community that requirements should be complete, unambiguous, and verifiable. This is why many professional requirements engineers use these techniques only as tools for informal requirements elicitation, analysis, and validation. Instead during requirements analysis and specification, more experienced requirements engineers tend to develop and specify more formal textual requirements that are complete, unambiguous, and verifiable. This column will show how to transform incomplete and vague stories, scenarios, and use cases into a proper set of complete, unambiguous, and verifiable requirements.},

In the Rational Unified Process (RUP), objects and classes are identified from the use case model, which is a combination of the Use Case diagram and the Use Case Specification (UCS) document. The automation of the generation of the class model assumes that the UCS is complete, accurate and unambiguous. However, in reality, the UCS is written in free form natural language and is therefore likely ambiguous and complex. To avoid this problem, use case templates and guidelines are proposed for writing UCS. This paper presents a methodology to automate the transition from stakeholders' requests to the use case model. The methodology uses a natural language parser to parse stakeholders' requests according to various guidelines. The automation process is discussed with an example.},

Poor quality or late upload into the bus hardware would cause serious cost and overhead. Established software engineering methods were considered inadequate and needed to be cut short. Agile methods offer guidance when quality, flexibility and high speed need to be reconciled. However, we did not adopt any full agile method, but added single agile practices to our "process improvement toolbox". We suggested a number of classical process improvement activities (such as more systematic documentation and measurement) and combined them with agile elements (e.g. Test First Process). This combination seemed to foster acceptance of agile ideas and may help us to break the ice for a cautious extension of agile process improvement.},

abstract={The number of possible refactorings is unlimited, so no tool vendor will ever be able to provide custom refactorings for all specific user needs. Therefore, we propose a new kind of refactoring tools, which allow users to create, edit and compose required refactorings just like any other documents. The heart of such a refactoring editor is the ability to compose larger refactorings from existing ones. Computing the precondition of the composite refactoring from the preconditions of the composed refactorings is non-trivial since earlier transformations influence the truth of preconditions of later ones. The ability to calculate these effects without referring to a particular program to which the refactorings should be applied is called program-independent composition. It is the prerequisite for creating composite refactorings that are reusable on arbitrary programs. The main contribution of this paper is a formal model for automatic, program-independent composition of conditional program transformations. We show that conditional transformations, including refactorings, can be composed from a limited set of basic operations. Program-independent derivation of a precondition for the composite is based on the notion of "transformation description", which can be seen as a simplified, yet equally powerful, variant of Roberts' "postconditions" (Practical analysis for refactoring, Ph.D. Thesis (1999)). Our approach simplifies the implementation of refactoring tools - only the basic operations and the ability for composition must be hard coded in a tool. As a proof of concept, we sketch a transformation framework that implements our approach (jConditioner) and, based on the framework, an experimental refactoring tool (ConTraCT) that includes the editing capabilities that motivated our work. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Existing software development processes are still not flexible or practical enough for developing a system that requires a mix of existing processes to be used in the production of that system. In this paper, a formal specification language, called TUG (Tree with Unified Grammar), is presented to support a software development process that accommodates conventional software development, operational specification, rapid prototyping via software transformations, software reuse, software testing, and program proofs of correctness. The development process with TUG can not only allow for a mix of existing development processes applied to a given system but also can be adapted to one of existing development processes. The combination of existing development processes takes advantage of the strengths of each process in the system. The software development process with the aid of the TUG specification language can aid the production of reliable and reusable programs.},

abstract={This panel addresses the teaching of software development methods in undergraduate computer science and software engineering programs. Specifically, the panel focuses on the teaching of Extreme Programming (XP), which is one of the agile software development methods that have received much attention in the last decade. Following its origins in the industrial sector, XP has been explored in computer science and software engineering education, especially in educator symposiums that have been instituted in conferences on agile methods (e.g., [2]). This panel aims at discussing, together with the SIGCSE community, why and how to teach software development methods in general and XP in particular. Since the teaching of XP is discussed in this panel with respect to different courses, we believe that the panel is relevant for all SIGCSE members. The panel consists of three parts: A. Introducing XP: This short demonstration aims at presenting the essence of XP and of its 12 practices. It is conducted through an interactive activity with the attendees. B. Panelists presentations: The panelists highlight the teaching of XP with respect to different course-levels, as is described in what follows: Introductory courses (by Joe Bergin), software engineering courses (by James Caristi), capstone courses (by Yael Dubinsky), and the implementation of pair programming (one of the 12 XP practices) in different courses (by Laurie Williams). We believe that these descriptions may provide quite a comprehensive picture of how XP can be integrated into computer science and software engineering education. In order to strengthen our claim for the introduction of XP into the undergraduate computer science and software engineering curriculum, a cognitive analysis of XP, which explains how XP supports leaning processes, is presented as well (by Orit Hazzan). C. Open discussion with the audience. In what follows we briefly introduce XP and then present the personal statements of the panelists.},

abstract={The rise in popularity of agile software development methodologies such as Extreme Programming (XP), Crystal, DSDM and Feature-Driven Development has opened an opportunity for the software engineering education community. How can one capitalize on the strengths of agile development models while still appealing to established software engineering practices? The typical introductory software engineering course makes use of a team-based project to reinforce software process activities. The project normally runs for one academic term during which students a re led through life-cycle activities using a modified waterfall approach to software development. While useful in teaching software engineering process concepts, this approach limits the team's ability to utilize feedback from downstream process activities. It also limits the students' opportunity to understand process improvement from their own experiences. The ability to respond to project change is also dampened by the fact that teams do not have the time or resources in this format to modify, or refactor the design of a project component let alone incorporate a new or modified customer requirement. Agile methodologies promote an evolutionary approach to development using short incremental release cycles. We report on the experiences of conducting a team project in an introductory software engineering course using agile development techniques a t the Rochester Institute of Technology. Teams have the opportunity to experience multiple iterations of the software engineering life cycle and evolve a product design that allows for discoveries made during implementation and through the introduction of changing customer requirements. The project integrates the concept of test-driven development. This agile technique addresses testing early in the development process and reinforces the value of unit testing. The incorporation of agile techniques is not only useful for students in an introductory course, but may also be applied to upper division software engineering courses.},

All the XP practices are related to the quality criteria or elements and whether they have a positive or negative impact on a project is identified. There has been a tremendous effort in transformation from traditional methods to XP. This is also discussed and some suggestions made for a smoother transition. Finally, Quality Management (QM) activities that are a part of XP has also been identified.

abstract={Inter networking is becoming essential in every aspect of life with a fast pace. Education, communication, defense, banking, shopping and government etc use the inter networking widely for different purposes. Internet can be regarded as the most popularly and widely used inter networking phenomenon. Internet is getting unbounded day by day due to fast growth of users and advanced technology for speedy data transfer. As Internet is connecting users all around the world, hence networks are designed on the architecture of distributed environment rather than central. Due to growth of distributed complex networks intrusions and accidents are common hence security and reliability of the data has got an immediate attention of designer and developers especially for defense, transactions, and business communications. The software process has always played a vital role in the development of reliable and quality software product The better the software engineering process is the better the end software product is. Therefore it is the urgent requirement of the hour to introduce survivability concepts at each level of software process. The Rational Unified Process (RUP) is a process for the development of any kind of software. It incorporates six best practices to address root causes for complete elimination of symptoms of software failure. The Survivability is the concept, which if incorporated in RUP will ultimately ensure the maximum reliability, security, fault tolerance, safety, robustness, and performance. Risk mitigation is obtained easily by adding survivability in software development process. This paper is intended to discuss key survivability concepts, SNA and induction of survivability in RUP process workflows to improve the reliability of the process in terms of survivability.},

abstract={Agile Software Development has put a new focus on the question of how to share knowledge among members of software development teams. In contrast to heavy-weight, document-centric approaches, agile approaches rely on face-to-face communication for knowledge transfer. Pure face-to-face communication is not feasible when applying agile processes in a virtual team setting. In this paper, we argue that the right approach for virtual software development teams using agile methods lies between a radical "none but source code" standpoint, and the multitude of documents proposed by heavy-weight development standards. This paper introduces work on developing a system for the task-based capture and pro-active distribution of recurrent information needs that typically arise for developers, as well as potential ways to satisfy these information needs. Our approach facilitates an incremental organizational learning process to capture and maintain knowledge on what documentation/information is actually needed, such that documentation is created on an "as needed" basis. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

abstract={How to exchange product model data between different application system via Internet is a very important problem for the collaborative product development in the agile manufacturing. A Web-enabled method based on the STEP (The Standard for Exchange of Product model data) and XML (Extendable Markup Language) will be put forward in this paper. According to this way, the product model data can be shared in different CAx systems on the Internet. The concepts of STEP and EXPRESS, XML and DTD are also be introduced. The integrated technology of product model data with STEP and XML, and the structure of the application system will also be given. Based on STEP and XML, the product data can be exchanged between the different application environment, and finally can be used to facilitate the collaborative product development in agile manufacturing.},

abstract={This paper introduces a multi-agent system which integrates process planning and scheduling activities in order to enhance the responsiveness of manufacturing systems and acts as a means to achieve agile manufacturing. The agents in this system collaborate with each other to obtain an integrated plan and schedule that carries the minimum production cost while satisfying the promised delivery due dates. The agent co-ordination protocol used is based on a contact-net bidding protocol, where the bidding process is carried out iteratively based on a currency scheme. In the scheme jobs announced to the agents are assigned with virtual currency values which have an effect on agent bidding decisions. These values are iteratively optimised with the purpose of searching for an optimum bid that satisfies due dates and gives the lowest production cost. To optimise the currency values at each iteration, a tabu search algorithm is proposed. The multi-agent system has been implemented on a Java platform. A test case and the results obtained will be discussed in this paper.},

Several frameworks dealing with quality issues of software processes are being developed and implemented by software organizations in order to become software development more closely related to an engineering project. One of the most critical difficulties to implement them is how to interpret the generic statements of these models and how to transform them in daily executable activities. The international Standard that deals with software processes definition is the ISO/IEC 12207. As other generic frameworks, this Standard does not prescribe any specific implementation life cycle model, method or tool. In the other hand, commercial models and frameworks, such as the Rational Unified Process (RUP), prescribes detailed implementation guidelines. This paper focuses on investigating how RUP can be used to implement the ISO/IEC 12207 Standard.},

In the face of uncertain requirements, our methodology exploits some ideas from agile software development approaches such as Extreme Programming, namely the values of collaboration with domain experts and of human creativity driven by rapid feedback. We support collaboration by means of a tool-supported modeling approach that allows one to capture existing and agentified processes in a format that is sufficiently simple to be understood and maintained by domain experts. These process models can be automatically synchronized with executable agent source code, so that rapid feedback is ensured. We support creativity by means of a searchable repository of reusable agent design patterns and other types of process modeling knowledge. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

Our thesis is that most of XP practices (pair programming, daily build, the simplest design or the metaphor) are technology independent and therefore can be used in FM based developments. Additionally, other essential pieces like test first, incremental development and refactoring can be improved by using FM. In the paper we explore in a certain detail those pieces: when you write a formal specification you are saying what your code must do, when you write a test you are doing the same so the idea is to use formal specifications as tests. Incremental development is quite similar to the refinement process in FM: specifications evolve to code maintaining previous functionality. Finally FM can help to remove redundancy, eliminate unused functionality and transform obsolete designs into new ones, and this is refactoring. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

abstract={The management information models currently used in the Internet have several limitations. Some of them contain errors, are missing important features, or are difficult to understand. Second, standards bodies keep reinventing the wheel, which confuses the terminology (hence customers) and wastes precious time. Third, finding a good balance between too abstract and overly detailed models is a tough challenge, rarely achieved in practice. Last, the learning curve of existing data models is too steep. We propose to alleviate these problems by adopting a new process for designing and standardizing management information models. It is inspired by two techniques from software engineering: the iterative and incremental software development process, which addresses the shortcomings of the waterfall process usually adhered to by the IETF and DMTF; and multi-tier models, which capture different perspectives (e.g., analysis, design, and implementation) of the information model. Our main innovations are management-architecture-neutral universal information models (UIMs), sharing of conceptual models by different standards bodies, and specialization of the people involved in designing the different layers of the models. Our new process takes into account a number of constraints identified in real-life environments.},

abstract={Refactorings are source-to-source program transformations which change program structure and organisation, but not program functionality. Documented in catalogues and supported by tools, refactoring provides the means to adapt and improve the design of existing code, and has thus enabled the trend towards modern agile software development processes. Refactoring has taken a prominent place in software development and maintenance, but most of this recent success has taken place in the OO and XP communities. In our project, we explore the prospects for 'Refactoring Functional Programs', taking Haskell as a concrete case-study. This paper discusses the variety of pragmatic and implementation issues raised by our work on the Haskell Refactorer. We briefly introduce the ideas behind refactoring, and a set of elementary functional refactorings. The core of the paper then outlines the main challenges that arise from our aim to produce practical tools for a decidedly non-toy language, summarizes our experience in trying to establish the necessary meta-programming infrastructure and gives an implementation overview of our current prototype refactoring tool. Using Haskell as our implementation language, we also offer some preliminary comments on Haskell programming-in-the-large.},

abstract={This paper discusses the adoption level of and experiences from using agile practices in three software development projects in a large Telecom company. The use of agile practices was more emergent than planned. Project managers and developers simply used practices they considered efficient and natural. The most widely adopted agile practices were to measure progress by working code, to have developers estimate task efforts, to use coding standards, having no continuous overtime, to have the team develop its own processes, to use limited documentation, and to have the team in one physical location. The projects used conventional testing approaches. Adoption of agile testing practices, i.e., test first and automated unit tests, was low. Some agile practices can just emerge without conscious adoption, because developers find them useful. However, it seems that an emergent process aiming for agility may also neglect important agile practices. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

Secondly, derived from XML (eXtensible Markup Language) as a sublanguage, ppXML is a standard and yet extensible modeling language dedicated to the modelling of products and product platforms for PPD web services. Thirdly, ppXML serves as a product platform repository and a PPD web service registry, together with a set of online facilities for data representation and transformation between different components and parties involved in the web services. Finally, ppXML is a proof-of-the-concept online PPD portal, incorporating some essential web-based Decision Support Systems (DSS) for product platform development and product platform customization. This paper presents an overview of ppXML together with its background and underlying philosophy.},

This meta-model is approached by extending the traditional activity network model with modeling constructs such as wait connectors, parallel blocks, services and modification blocks. The technique for dynamic modification based on the meta-model is also addressed. Practical examples show that the meta-model has significant advantages like strong expressive power, flexible modeling methods, and clear and concise model structures.},

To solve this model a general consistency algorithm, which can deal with both algebra equations but also ordinary differential equations, is put forward and implemented combining with interval arithmetic and the genetic algorithm to refine the design variable and state variable intervals. With the help of this method, designers could infer the consistent solution space from the given specifications.

However, a single standard grammar is not always appropriate for all source analysis and manipulation tasks. Small custom modifications to the grammar can make the programs used to implement these tasks simpler, clearer and more efficient. This leads to a new paradigm for programming these tools: agile parsing. In agile parsing the effective grammar used by a particular tool is a combination of two parts: the standard base grammar for the input language, and a set of explicit grammar overrides that modify the parse to support the task at hand. This paper introduces the basic techniques of agile parsing in TXL and discusses several industry proven techniques for exploiting agile parsing in software source analysis and transformation.},

abstract={The quantitative analysis of three-dimensional (3-D) shapes in terms of morphology and functionality is one of the most challenging problems in medical image analysis. This paper proposes a general methodology that aims at solving part of this problem. It introduces a nonparametric hierarchical partitioning approach that operates on any arbitrary 3-D shape described as a triangle mesh. It first extends the concept of basin districts to the case of curved spaces through a partitioning process on a valuation representing the main curvatures over a polyhedral support. A hierarchical construction of basin districts is obtained from a watershed transform. The speed of the front propagation on the polyhedral surface is controlled by the local characteristics of the surface geometry. As a prerequisite, a set of co-processing tools has been developed that operates directly on a triangulated domain. This includes classical signal processing tasks (e.g., re-sampling, filtering) on a polyhedral support performing a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. The ability to provide an intrinsic shape partition from any triangular mesh is useful in a wide range of applications from accurate geometric modeling, and hierarchical shape dissection to robust mesh compression. Examples are presented in the paper to illustrate the principles and methodology. © 2003 IEEE.},

abstract={We introduce the observe-mine-adopt (OMA) paradigm that assists organizations in making improvements to their software development processes without committing to and undertaking large-scale sweeping organizational process improvement. Specifically, the approach has been applied to improve software practices focused on maintainability. This novel approach is based on the theory that software teams naturally make observations about things that do or do not work well. Teams then mine their artifacts and their recollections of events to find the software products, processes, metrics, etc. that led to the observation. In the case of software maintainability, it is then necessary to perform some measurement to ensure that the methods result in improved maintainability. We introduce two maintainability measures, maintainability product and perceived maintainability, to address this need. Other maintainability measures that may be used in the mine step are also examined. Finally, if the mining activities lead to validated discoveries of processes, techniques or practices that improve the software product, they are formalized and adopted by the team. OMA has been studied experimentally using two project studies and a Web-based health care system which is maintained by a large industrial software organization.

These processes are intended to support early and quick production of working code by structuring the development into small release cycles and focus on continual interaction between developers and customers. As such software development processes become more popular, there is a growing demand from industry to introduce agile development practices in tertiary education. This is not a straightforward task as the corresponding practices may run counter to educational goals or may not be adjusted easily to a learning environment. In this paper, we discuss some of these issues and reflect on the problems of teaching agile processes in tertiary education.},

This paper outlines an approach to producing effective program documentation by connecting technical communicators and technical developers in a pair-wise manner. This approach is modeled on the development methodology advocated by eXtreme Programming (XP). Programmers who adopt XP work in pairs, and thus are in constant communication with one another. By pairing a technical communicator with a technical developer, many of the same benefits can be gained. Rather than eschewing program documentation, the paired communicator and developer instead produce high-quality documentation during the development process, with little extra effort, resulting in a more maintainable software application. The paper also describes some recent experiences in pairing a senior person and a junior person in communicator and developer roles to enhance program documentation of a long-lived and popular research application.},

This paper describes our investigations into appropriate algorithms for optimizing the derived OSE metrics. By adapting equilibrium concepts from microeconomic theory, we demonstrate that, with the spectrum management authority acting as "market arbiter", OSE optimization for individual entities can lead to efficient group-level spectrum utilization solutions.

abstract={With more and more air interfaces introduced into the wireless market, the product spectrum of different base stations by a worldwide-engaged infrastructure vendor becomes increasingly diverse. Therefore, it is desirable to shrink the product spectrum while still matching the different market needs. This paper presents key enabling technologies, such as radio frequency-microelectromechanical system (RF-MEMS) and silicon carbide/gallium nitride (SiC/GaN) transistors, which allow fora base station radio architecture that can be reconfigured. The paper first analyses the market scenario and compares the principles of a reconfigurable radio with classical software radio technology. Direct-mixing transceiver architecture is proposed for implementation, and solutions for multi-band capability are discussed. RF-MEMS devices are used to switch filters, tune capacitances and inductances, and specifically adapt impedance matching. For multi-band power amplifiers, the benefit of operating a SiC or GaN radio frequency (RF) power device at high voltage is addressed. All these technologies lead to an analog software radio (also called frequency agile radio) where it will turn out that such a radio can be realized at less complexity and cost compared to a classical digital software radio. Furthermore, it will show up that analog software radio technology based on RF-MEMS also has the potential to enter the terminal market. ©2003 Lucent Technologies Inc.},

abstract={Parity, body condition score (BCS), and dry matter intake (DMI) data of 699 Holsteins fed 49 different diets during the final 3 wk of gestation (prefresh transition period) were compiled from 16 experiments conducted at eight universities. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of animal and dietary factors on DMI and to elucidate interactions between animal and dietary factors and among dietary factors on DMI during the prefresh transition period. Animal factors examined were parity and BCS, whereas dietary factors examined were rumen undegradable protein (RUP), rumen degradable protein (RDP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and ether extract (EE). DMI decreased 32% during the final 3 wk of gestation, and 89% of that decline occurred during the final week of gestation. Day of gestation, animal factors, and dietary factors accounted for 56.1, 19.7, and 24.2% of explained variation in DMI, respectively, and R2 of this linear multivariable model was 0.18. Cows had higher DMI than heifers. DMI decreased linearly as BCS, RUP, and NDF increased, decreased quadratically as EE increased, and increased quadratically as RDP increased. Moreover, the magnitude of DMI depression as animals approached parturition was affected by characteristics of animals and dietary nutrient composition. There were significant parity x EE, BCS x NDF, RUP x NDF, RDP x NDF, NDF x EE, and RUP x EE interactions on DMI. In conclusion, parity, BCS, and concentrations of organic macronutrients in diets affected DMI during the prefresh transition period, and the magnitude of DMI depression as animals approached parturition.},

Based on the "Waterfall" generic model, they include well-known process models defining the development process by finding and executing a plan of actions leading to the solution without mentioning a particular connection to the resulting product. A product is a specification of the solution to develop produced by an engineer. The product-oriented process models represent the development process through the evolution of the product. Their advantage is to put the product definition in the foreground and push the process definition in the background. But the process is defined as an organized set of transformation activities that do not allow the capturing of the semantic attached to them. The purpose of the more recent approach gathering process models is to emphasize the decisional aspect of the process. The successive transformations of the product are consequences of human decisions. Such models are semantically more powerful than previous ones because they explain not only how the process proceeds but also why transformations happen. Considering the limitations of the first two classes of process models, we think that the decision-oriented ones are the best adapted to describe the MIS process modelling. The paper shows an instanciation of the "Nature" model to Object-Oriented Modelling and Design (OMT) methodology process.},

abstract={Key technologies like the World Wide Web, object-orientation, and distributed computing enable new applications, e.g., in the area of electronic commerce, management of information systems, and decision support systems. Today, many companies face the problem that they have to reengineer pre-existing information systems to take advantage of these technologies. Various computer-aided reengineering tools have been developed to reduce the complexity of the reengineering task. A major limitation of current approaches, however, is that they impose a strictly phase-oriented, waterfall-type reengineering process, with little support for iterations. Still, such iterations often occur in real-world examples, e.g., when additional knowledge about the legacy system becomes available or when the legacy system is modified during an ongoing migration process. In this paper, we present an approach to incremental consistency management that allows to overcome this limitation in the domain of database systems by integrating reverse and forward engineering activities in an intertwined process. The described mechanism is based on a formalization of conceptual schema translation and redesign transformations by graph rewriting rules and has been implemented and evaluated with the Varlet database reengineering environment. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

From its humble beginning Software Process Improvement (SPI) has spread its wings into virtually every sector of the software engineering community and in the process has transformed itself from a bag of tools and techniques, into a serious set of methodologies for enhancing organisational effectiveness and competitive success. In the latter half of the 1990's individual SPI methodologies such as PSP [1] and PIPSI [2] were promulgated as approaches to make the individual a better software engineer. Surveys of European software organizations [3] have shown support for SPI. In Europe to date, SPI programmes have concentrated at the organisational level, with less adoption at the level of the individual. This paper explores the role of individual-level methodologies in a European context and details the results of a series of experiments conducted by the authors.},

abstract={In order to determine whether the amphidromous shrimp Atya innocous can breed successfully in freshwater above major obstacles to its upstream migration, we investigated the reproductive interactions among three local populations above high waterfalls or stream sections without runoff in Guadeloupe, Lesser Antilles. Reproductive interactions were investigated through the rates of genetic divergence (based on 8 allozyme loci) between populations. We also investigated four populations from streams without major obstacles. We recorded a high level of dispersal (Nm &gt; 13) between six local populations (from streams with or without major obstacles) resulting in the mixing of alleles (pairwise Fst values never significantly different from 0). Major obstacles did not separate upstream populations from those of neighbouring drainage basins and our results did not support the hypothesis that A. innocous can breed successfully in freshwater. As stressed elsewhere, shrimps (and particularly juveniles) are probably able to climb high waterfalls. Moreover, they probably use sub-surface passages to colonise upstream sections of certain rivers. On the contrary the seventh population (from a more distant stream without major obstacles) displayed a high degree of genetic differentiation (pairwise Fst&gt;0.8, P&lt;0.001). The detailed mechanism of its reproductive isolation remains to be solved. According to the published literature on decapods, the genetic distance recorded (mean D = 0.278) between the two groups of A. innocous in Guadeloupe falls within the range of sub-species.},

Agents are able to suggest certain operations to the users in response to the change in the data structures they are responsible to maintain. They can adopt using prior knowledge about company objectives and available customer data. Important role of the agent is to learn and change their practice according to previous approved behavior. The use of the fuzzy set theory, in order to maintain and analyze the knowledge kept in the company profiles, as well as to calculate the reliability of the suggested actions, showed the first positive experimental results.

abstract={The paper proposes the combination of three traditional modelling methods (analytical, continuous and discrete-event), into a unique hybrid two-level modelling approach, to address software process simulation modelling issues. At the higher abstraction level, the process is modelled by a discrete-event queueing network, which represents the component activities, their interactions, and the exchanged artefacts. At the lower abstraction level, the analytical and continuous methods are used to describe the behaviour of the introduced activities. The hybrid approach is applied to a waterfall-based software process to study the effects of requirements instability on various process quality attributes, such as effort, delivery time, productivity, rework percentage and product quality. Simulation results show that the use of the model can provide both qualitative and quantitative suggestions on how to improve the software process or on how to satisfy specific organisational needs. Although, the model has been primarily designed to represent the behaviour of hypothetical projects, and to allow researchers to view the implications of their assumptions, it can be easily customised and extended to become a tool for analysing and predicting the behaviour of actual projects. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract={Since the software radio concept was introduced, much progress has been made in the past few years in making it a reality. Many software-radio-based systems have been designed through the development efforts of both commercial and noncommercial organizations. While the term software radio has meant many things, the ultimate goal in software radio has been the realization of an agile radio that can transmit and receive signals at any carrier frequency using any protocol, all of which can be reprogrammed virtually instantaneously. Such a system places great demands on the limits of data converter and processor technologies since it requires real-time disposition of gigasamples of data produced by direct conversion of wireless signals into digital data. From a processing standpoint, the challenge in software radio is to exploit the three basic processor types - fixed architecture processors, FPGAs, and programmable DSPs/ RISCs/CISCs - in such a way as to optimize the three-way trade-offs between speed, power dissipation, and programmability. With respect to the latter characteristic, the issues of high-level language interfaces, portability, and reprogramming speed must be considered. This article describes the architecture and operation of a PC-based software radio receiver. The development environment is a real-time PC-based platform that allows testing to be done in a simple manner using the main software functionality of a PC. The front-end of the receiver implemented in hardware represents a novel wideband design (bandwidth of up to 100 MHz centered at a carrier frequency of up to 2 GHz) that functionally converts wireless signals directly into a gigasample digital data stream in the receiver (and vice versa in the transmitter). This direct conversion approach shows the greatest promise in realizing the main goal of software radio.},

abstract={As application of cluster tools is being extended to more wafer fabrication processes including chemical vapor deposition processes as well as etching processes, cluster tool configurations and wafer flow patterns tend to be more complicated. Frequent recipe changes require prompt adaptation of the scheduling logic to cope with changed configurations and wafer flow patterns. The scheduler should be responsive to occurrences of various events within the tool and should be able to coordinate and control complicated activities and tasks of the process modules and the wafer-handling robot. Moreover, the scheduler should meet a critical timing constraint that a wafer should leave the process module within a specified time limit after processing. Therefore, it is essential to have a systematic, flexible and agile method of developing a robust real-time scheduler. To do this, we propose a model-based approach based on finite state machines (FSMs) to develop a real-time scheduler for dual-armed cluster tools. We propose the scheduling decisions for normal operation. We then develop a scheduler model based on FSMs that specifies the scheduling decisions for normal operation and encodes real-time control decisions to cope with disturbances. We then verify the scheduler model and transform the model into an executable control code. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={Validation testing of software processes may provide both qualitative and quantitative suggestions to understand the ways to change the software process to improve its quality, or the ways to achieve specific organisation's needs. In many cases, however, such understanding has to be done without affecting the actual environment. To this purpose, this paper introduces the use of process simulators for validation testing. To be effective, however, simulators must combine the ability to sustain the complexity of the modelling problem with the so-called dynamic estimation capability, that is the capability of representing the dynamics of the simulated process. To achieve such objectives, the introduced simulator is based on the association of three conventional modelling methods (analytical, continuous and discrete-event) into a unique hybrid multi-level new model, called dynamic capability model (DCM). The paper applies DCM in the context of a waterfall-based software process to study the effects of three different quality assurance management policies on given process quality attributes, as effort, delivery time, productivity, rework percentage, and product quality. The verification of the simulator representativeness is also performed by reproducing empirically known facts in the process behaviour. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

Liver biopsies were obtained on d -28, -14, 1, 28, and 56 relative to calving, and the abundances of AS, OTC, PC, PEPCK, and 18S mRNA were determined by Northern blot analysis of total RNA. The abundance of OTC mRNA was lowest at calving and was decreased by RPC and 6.2% RUP feeding. Feeding 6.2% RUP did not alter AS, PC, or PEPCK mRNA. The expression of AS mRNA increased and PEPCK mRNA tended to increase from calving to 56 DIM. Pyruvate carboxylase mRNA increased more than twofold at calving. The data indicated adaptation to lactation for gluconeogenic enzymes that is not matched in direction and magnitude by changes in mRNA for urea cycle enzymes. Feeding additional protein, as RUP, failed to induce mRNA for key enzymes in gluconeogenesis or ureagenesis.},

abstract={eCommerce requires the rapid development of large systems. Two requirements for success are a lightweight process, such as eXtreme Programming; and avoiding the reinvention of skills (embodied in patterns) and software (embodied in components). In order to use components successfully, we have to define their interfaces carefully. Although this should be done with test code (in the XP style) in practice the tests form a very clumsy basis for thinking about the components' behaviours. UML provides a more readable basis, provided it is used at a high level of abstraction (not just pictures of the code) and provided it is directly connected to the interface tests. The use of UML to define tests contrasts strongly with the typical transformation of UML into program code. In recent times, a growing body of developers have reported disappointing results with 'reverse engineering', finding that UML diagrams drawn from complex code are just as hard to follow and re-engineer as the code itself. This tutorial will show how to use UML to make useful abstract descriptions of component and system requirements and interfaces; how to translate those to tests; and how to integrate component based development with eXtreme Programming.},

abstract={Knowledge is a human construction. Everything people do and create, including their organizations is thus human constructed. The process of knowledge construction is as much a part of an organization's distinctiveness as is its knowledge content. Knowledge binding is one model for studying this process. Knowledge binding refers to the relative distance between a specification and its implementation. This distance governs the very character of an organization: its structure, processes, culture, and so on, and is largely responsible for business success or failure. Comparatively stable nineteenth and twentieth-century business environments favored early knowledge binding - long lead-time between specification and implementation, and thus gave rise to organizations with predictable characteristics, such as hierarchies, waterfall software development models, management by objectives, top-down management processes, etc. In contrast, the dynamicity of twenty-first century business environment requires late knowledge binding (i.e., short distance and time between specification and implementation), and gives rise to organizations with a whole new set of characteristics.},

In this way up to two million samples can be stored in DSP external memory. The samples are analyzed by directly fast Fourier transforming blocks of samples. In another mode we use software-based downmixing and filtering techniques to increase the resolution and zoom in on a small frequency band. Spectra of up to 5 MHz can be manipulated and displayed as waterfall plots or spectral maps on the host computer directly. Moreover, signals of up to 70 MHz can be analyzed by undersampling techniques. We use this system to analyze Schottky spectra from electron-cooled ion beams in CELSIUS and report drag rate measurements and observations of instabilities.},

We explore the need for companies to appear in multiple, simultaneous roles in multiple, simultaneous marketspaces. Then we drill deeper to look at the business case for I-markets, their inter-enterprise business processes and the agile software needed to support new and changing business models. Armed with this framework, we move on to describe the key dimensions of strategy that companies will need in order to succeed as 21st century markets transform from places to spaces.

Significant differences in allele frequencies were found between five sections within a 3-km range, even when no physical barriers prevented fish from migrating between sections. It is argued that geological structures may rise to patterns resembling isolation by distance. Seemingly, the most important factor causing genetic differentiation in Nordre Finnvikelv is genetic drift in small populations that are geologically subdivided by a tributary and by impassable waterfalls. Some correlation between previous behavioural observations and genetic structures were found.},

abstract={Emerging key technologies like the World Wide Web, object-orientation, and distributed computing enable new applications, e.g., in the area of electronic commerce, management information systems, and decision support systems. Today, many companies face the problem that they have to reengineer pre-existing information systems to take advantage of these technologies. Various computer-aided reengineering tools have been developed to reduce the complexity of the reengineering task. However, a major limitation of current approaches is that they impose a strictly phase-oriented, waterfall-type reengineering process, without the support for iterations. Still, such iterations often occur in real world examples, e.g., when additional knowledge about the legacy system becomes available or when the legacy system is modified during the migration process. In this paper, we present an approach to incremental consistency management that allows to overcome this limitation by integrating reverse and forward engineering activities in an intertwined process. The described mechanism is based on a formalization of redesign transformations by graph rewriting rules and has been implemented in the Varlet reengineering environment.},

abstract={Various activities associated with software development are now being standardized in the software life cycle process (SLCP) which is under review at ISO. In developing telecommunications software by taking a conventional approach to software development, the structured design technique based on the waterfall model has so far been used in a software development process which is one of the elements composing SLCP. It is pointed out, however, that this conventional design technique has limitations with respect to the transference of technology and quality evaluation. On the other hand, new techniques of software development, such as object-oriented programming, prototyping, and spiral modeling are being introduced into computer software development. These new development techniques are expected to provide a solution to the transference of technology and other problems related to software development. In practice, however, introduction of these techniques to the development of telecommunications software is delayed because the scale of development is relatively large, a high level of real-time performance is sought, memory capacity is limited, and other reasons. With the emergence of a general-purpose telecommunications operating system (OS), upgrading of development environments, and decreasing cost of memory in recent years, it is now becoming possible to introduce these new techniques into the field of computer software development. Against this background, we applied a new development approach based on spiral modeling to the development of telecommunications software and compared it with the conventional development approach with respect to the productivity of software development, the qualify of software programs, and other factors. Although the man-hour control and some other technical problems were left unsolved in experimenting with this new development approach based on spiral modeling, we were able to obtain overall good results regarding productivity and the quality of software. © 1998 Scripta Technica.},

abstract={For the past decades, programmable logic controllers (PLC's) using relay ladder logic (RLL) programming have been the workhorse for controlling event-driven industrial automated systems. RLL proved flexible compared to the hardwired RLL control implementation, due to its feature of software implementation. As automated systems become more complex, they also become more difficult to understand and maintain. It takes tremendous effort to accommodate specification changes, which become frequent, to meet today's flexible and agile automation needs. Several methods emerge to overcome the shortcomings of RLL. Petri nets (PN's), initially proposed as a modeling tool, have been developed as such a method. This paper adopts an industrial scale system to compare RLL and PN design methods so that the advantages of PN-like approaches are fully recognized. The criteria are the understandability that relates to the ability to evaluate the programmed logic, to verify its correctness, and to maintain the control system as well as the flexibility that relates to the easy modification of logic when the specification changes. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first work that takes an existing industrial system, conducts discrete event control designs by using both RLL programming and PN methods, and performs a comparative study on them. Together with the previous comparison results through small-scale systems, the results of this study support that PN-like advanced discrete event control design methods are better than RLL, in terms of the understandability and flexibility of a resulting control design. © 1998 IEEE.},

abstract={Most everyone in our field acknowledges that software process improvement cannot succeed unless management is committed to implementing it. Fortunately, the move to SPI can be a two-way street, initiated as easily from the bottom up as from the top down. Taking this bottom-up approach, I present some tricks that practitioners down in the trenches can use to win upper management's approval of and support for SPI. My first opportunity to introduce bottom-up process changes occurred on a project in which my job was basically coding and testing. Initially, I was assigned to the maintenance coding of the product's previous release, which proved to be a real headache. So I had my motives for making improvements. According to the waterfall model we were using, the project was about halfway through the design phase. A lot of lower-level design and unit and integration testing remained. I was assigned one part of the system, and the remaining design and unit testing tasks were given to the 15 people we had allocated to us for the next five months. Given the amount of work that lay before us, these resources were not nearly enough. One subproject leader realized that our complex and lengthy design task would prove a huge challenge.},

abstract={The technologies enabling agile manufacturing (TEAM) program enhances industrial capability by advancing and deploying manufacturing technologies that promote agility. TEAM has developed a product realization process that features the integration of product design and manufacturing groups. TEAM uses the tools it collects, develops, and integrates in support of the product realization process to demonstrate and deploy agile manufacturing capabilities for three high- priority processes identified by industry: material removal, forming, and electromechanical assembly. In order to provide a proof-of-principle, the material removal process has been addressed first and has been successfully demonstrate din an 'interconnected' mode. An internet-accessible intersite file manager (IFM) application has been deployed to allow geographically distributed TEAM participants to share and distribute information as the product realization process is executed. An automated inspection planning application has been demonstrated, importing a solid model form the IFM, generating an inspection plan and a part program to be used in the inspection process, and then distributing the part program to the inspection site via the IFM. TEAM seeks to demonstrate the material removal process in an integrated mode in June 1997 complete with an object-oriented framework and infrastructure. The current status and future plans for this project are presented here. ©2005 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.},

Application of the technique can be specfically tailored to embedded, interactive and multimedia applications, as well as those systems requiring a well defined approach in the quality assurance process. The authors introduce an approach for performance enhancement during the testing process. Problems faced when constructing software systems in time-constrained, market-driven development processes are highlighted. Emphasis is given to test process improvements by stressing some of the 'failures' encountered when using traditional test models. Traditionally, testing follows the stages of specify, develop, test and release in a standard waterfall based approach. The use of viewpoints will be introduced as a technique for structuring, identification, organisation and deployment of test information. Finally, the method is illustrated with a small example using a bank ATM machine. In conclusion, the authors evaluate VOCAL, and outline areas of future work. © IEE, 1997.},

Therefore, the completeness, readability and accuracy of the software specification directly influences the quality of the final software product. A waterfall development model is not assumed. It is assumed, however, that software specifications are kept 'alive' and relevant. The purpose of this work is to provide a methodology for deriving quantitative measures of the quality of the software specifications document. These measures are designed to complement good engineering judgment that has to be applied in order to judge the quality of a software specifications document. Quantitative measures (i.e., metrics) will help reveal problem areas in various dimensions of quality characteristics. We focus here on completeness, readability and accuracy.

abstract={Manufacturers focus on becoming more agile, software firms deploy rapid application development tools - everyone is in a hurry. Although we all understand the benefits of being first to market, we understand just as clearly that not all first-to-market products enjoy the same, sustainable benefits from being market pioneers. Why do some pioneering products experience a more significant order-of-entry effect than others? Roger A. Kerin, Gurumurthy Kalyanaram, and Daniel J. Howard examine two factors - product hierarchy and brand strategy - which may influence the magnitude of this effect for new consumer packaged goods. First, they hypothesize that pioneering a new product class offers a greater advantage than introducing a new form to an existing product class. Second, they predict that the order-of-entry effect will be greater for brand extensions than for entirely new brands. Finally, considering both product hierarchy and brand strategy, they expect that the order-of-entry advantage for brand extensions over new brands will be significantly greater within new product classes than for new forms of existing products. These hypotheses are tested using data from the Information Resources, Inc. Behaviorscan® data set. Collected from 2,500 household panel members, 75 supermarkets, and 25 drugstores, this database contains weekly measures of brand trial penetration as well as brand distribution, price, and promotion information in eight geographic markets from the period 1983-1988. The models developed in this study explore the relationships among brand trial penetration, product hierarchy, brand strategy, order of entry, lag time between successive brand entrants, and marketing mix variables (i.e., price, promotion, distribution, and advertising). The study strongly supports all three hypotheses. In particular, the analysis clearly demonstrates that the order-of-entry effect is greatest for a new product class pioneered by a brand extension. Order of entry has the least effect on a new product form pioneered by an entirely new brand. For a company seeking a competitive advantage from being first to market, innovation in product function offers greater potential benefit than innovation in product form. Such a company can also benefit from building on the name and reputation of its established brands. Although the study finds these order-of-entry effects significant, the effects of marketing mix variables such as product price and promotion are consistently stronger.},

abstract={Having competitive processes has become as important (if not more) as having competitive products. Simply designing good products is not enough to gain competitive edge. Business processes have grown complex and fragmented in an ad-hoc manner. They span several departments and are very inefficient. Often the work being performed conflicts with the organizations' goals and strategic objectives. Traditional practices and policies tend to encourage this, resulting in being part of the problem instead of being part of the solution. This paper presents a model driven methodology for Business Process Engineering (BPE) to support an organization's migration to effective, agile and efficient processes. The essential elements of the methodology are process modeling, process analysis, and process execution by utilizing an array of information technologies. The methodology steps depend on process models for understanding, analyzing, simulating, improving, innovating, and implementing the business processes. The methodology starts by defining the goals and objectives of the BPE project. Candidate business processes are identified. The selected strategic 'As-Is' business processes are analyzed to find where problems exist. Several techniques are employed to engineer the 'To-Be' process. The new process may be a radical departure from the old process. The alternatives are evaluated using cost/benefit analysis. The selected processes are then implemented using a phased approach that relies on information technology solutions along with the implementation of recommended organizational and cultural changes. A continuous improvement program is put into place to ensure long term success.},

abstract={We introduce a new kind of diagnostic sensor that combines multifunctional measurement capabilities for ionospheric research. Multifunctionality is realized through agility in frequency selection over an extended band (1.5 to 50 MHz), system modularity, complete system control by software written in C, and a user-friendly computer interface. This sensor, which we call the frequency-agile radar (FAR), incorporates dual radar channels and an arbitrary waveform synthesizer that allows creative design of sophisticated waveforms as a means of increasing its sensitivity to weak signals while minimizing loss in radar resolution. The sensitivity of the FAR is determined by two sets of power amplifier modules: four 4-kW solid-state broadband amplifiers, and four 30-kW vacuum tube amplifiers. FAR control is by an AT-bus personal computer with on-line processing by a programmable array processor. The FAR does not simply house the separate functions of most radio sensors in use today, it provides convenient and flexible access to those functions as elements to be used in any combination. Some of the first new results obtained with the FAR during recent field campaigns are presented to illustrate its versatility. These include (1) the first detection of anomalous high-frequency (HF) reflections from a barium ion cloud, (2) the first evidence of unexpectedly large drifts and a shear north of the equatorial electrojet, (3) the first HF radar signature of a developing equatorial plasma bubble, and (4) the first measurements by a portable radar of altitude-extended, quasi-periodic backscatter from midlatitude sporadic E. We also mention the potential of the FAR for atmospheric remote sensing.},

abstract={The development of concurrent applications, which consist of several parallel, often distributed, activities that communicates and synchronize with each other, presents challenging logical and technological issues. In the common practice, technological aspects, which are related to the definition of concurrent processes as well as of their interactions, often place constraints on the logical ones. Consequently, the flexibility that could be attained during design is reduced and, further, an actual implementation where both aspects are deeply intermixed is usually obtained. The aim of the research presented in this paper is twofold. On the one hand, an expressive and flexible language based on object-oriented high-level nets is proposed so that designers can naturally represent concurrency and synchronization. On the other hand, a powerful support toolset is provided so that design models based on nets can effectively be transformed into processes while minimizing and clearly separating the interactions with the underlying operating system and network facilities.},

abstract={This work is about the formal specification of transaction-based, interactive information systems. A transaction is a task that the user can execute independently, and the system can be defined as a partially ordered set of transactions. The general framework is the transformational paradigm, based on the classical Waterfall development model [28]. The stages are system analysis, software specification, design, and implementation. In this work, the systems analysis and software specification stages are covered. An informal, transaction-oriented method for systems analysis is proposed. The resulting system specification involves two parts: a high-level specification of each transaction and a formal specification of the system's control flow, i.e., the order of execution of the transactions. The system's control flow is expressed in a formal language describing concurrent regular expressions built on transaction names. The detailed specification and design of a transaction was covered in an earlier article [3]. At the software specification stage, some operational requirements, such as connect/ disconnect transactions and the application of the all-or-nothing principle, are added to the system specification. Then a serial product automation (SPA) is used to transform the concurrent expression into a single regular expression. This result is proven to be consistent with the system specification.},

Finally, we explain how implementation techniques proposed by other authors can be integrated in our framework.},

abstract={Since the early 1970s, the waterfall model has been the basis for most development life cycles. The model stipulates that software is developed in successive stages with a feedback loop between stages. To confine the feedback loops between consecutive stages and minimize the expensive rework involved in feedback across many stages, Fagan (1979) introduced in 1974, in IBM Kingston, NY, a method of static testing called the inspection process. The method involves the developer and others in a formal process of investigation to verify that software meets his requirements. However, the waterfall model has encountered some fundamental difficulties in taking into account current approaches to software engineering, including rapid prototyping for interactive end-user applications, object orientation, software reuse, or re-engineering. Boehm (1988) suggested a spiral model, creating a risk-driven approach for improving the software development process situation. This article opens with a short description of both the software development process and the inspection process. Subsequent sections illustrate the application of the inspection process to incremental development; summarize the use of software inspections in the development of an IBM communication controller by highlighting the economical dimension of such an application; and finally present the resulting conclusions.},

abstract={Knowledge-based systems have often been criticized for the limited theoretical base on which they are constructed. The partially valid view, held by many, is that systems are often constructed in an ad hoc, individual way, which leads to unmaintainable, unreliable, and unrigorous systems. This holds even though there have been several attempts at producing development methodologies to assist the knowledge engineer in the construction process1-7. A large contributing reason for the limited applicability of these methodologies is that they often too closely follow the waterfall model approach used for the development of conventional software systems8. This approach forces developers to make large jumps in the system state during development, which is not necessarily the most conductive way to model the domain accurately. The paper therefore aims to introduce a new alternative approach that shows the benefits of taking a software engineering philosophy towards the development of knowledge-based systems. The methodology breaks down the process of creating a knowledge-based system into constituent parts and discusses ways of creating rigorous specifications for those parts, as applicable. This includes specifying the knowledge base, the representation, the control architecture, etc., thus promoting quality systems that are better specified, more reliable, and easier to maintain. © 1991.},

abstract={This chapter is an introduction to several aspects of computer science that are are applicable to Geographical Information Systems. First, some of the choices in computer systems and the likely coming advances in hardware and software are discussed. Then some of the general properties of low-level data structures, with principles like abstract data structures versus their implementations, and examples like hash tables, extendible arrays, uniform grids and Voronoi diagrams are considered. Next there is an introduction to algorithms analysis, its limitations when applied to practical problems, new trends such as randomized algorithms and implementation considerations. This is followed by an introduction to software engineering, including the traditional waterfall model, the newer rapid prototyping technique and the importance of profiling the program to improve it. -Author},

abstract={Historically, the process of software development has played an important role in the field of software engineering. A number of software life-cycle models have been developed in the last three decades. These models, although helpful is giving general guidance to software developers, do not expose myriad details that are critical in any large software development project. Recent developments, however, have unfolded many hidden aspects of the software process, giving rise to a new discipline that we call software process engineering. This paper depicts software process in the context of software environments, examines recent developments in the process field and proposes the concept of process cycle, which embodies the scope of engineering and evolution of software processes. The paper describes the details of the process cycle, including such issues as the role of corporate goals and policies in the engineering, management, performance and improvement of software processes; the transformation of the process artifacts through the process cycle; role of human beings in this (meta-) process; and communications in the cycle.},

abstract={A major barrier in taking expert systems from prototype to operational status involves instilling end user confidence in the operational system. End users want assurances that their systems have been thoroughly tested, meet all their specifications and requirements, and are built based on designs which are reliable and maintainable. For most software systems, the waterfall life cycle model can provide those assurances. However, this model is inappropriate for expert system development, where an iterative refinement approach is commonly employed. This paper will look at different life cycle models and explore the advantages and disadvantages of each when applied to expert system development. The Fault Isolation Expert System for TDRSS Applications (FIESTA) is presented as a case study example of development of an expert system.},

abstract={This paper discusses resource utilization over the life cycle of software development and discusses the role that the current "waterfall" model plays in the actual software life cycle. Software production in the NASA environment was analyzed to measure these differences. The data from 13 different projects were collected by the Software Engineering Laboratory at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and analyzed for similarities and differences. The results indicate that the waterfall model is not very realistic in practice, and that as technology introduces further perturbations to this model with concepts like executable specifications, rapid prototyping, and wide-spectrum languages, we need to modify our model of this process. © 1988.},
